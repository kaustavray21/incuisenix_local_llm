1578.0,1582.0,these are
1582.0,1589.64,objects in Python. Okay. These four are container objects in Python inside which you can store
1589.64,1598.32,multiple elements. Okay. Account is asking how can open same page storage page to the
1598.32,1606.36,Jupyter node. Okay. Okay. Okay. Open the same file that you worked on yesterday. You
1606.36,1612.04,must have given some name. Open this from file option. They will be an open option. Click
1612.04,1617.7199999999998,on file and open and then look out for the same page name that you've given to your notebook
1617.7199999999998,1624.6799999999998,yesterday and the same page will open up. Okay. Look out for the name that you have given
1624.6799999999998,1632.9599999999998,and that eventual page will load up notebook. Okay. See. The people now quickly start understand
1632.96,1639.6000000000001,"that list, Apple, Z and dictionary are nothing but container objects in Python. Okay. Let's"
1639.6000000000001,1645.92,"just understand in a container, you can store multiple objects like let me say you have a"
1648.56,1653.1200000000001,"miss a closet. There is a closet near your home, right? There is a closet or an almerian"
1653.1200000000001,1660.08,"home inside which you can store multiple different elements, right? You can store multiple"
1660.08,1668.48,"different elements, right? In the same way container works in Python also where we can store"
1668.48,1675.28,"multiple elements together. Getting my point, this is what is meant by containers. Unless"
1675.28,1683.76,"tuple, set and dictionary are nothing but container objects in Python in which we can store multiple"
1683.76,1690.96,elements of what choice this is the basic meaning of containers. These are nothing but container
1690.96,1702.72,objects. We like to use containers and the very first container that we have been talking about
1702.72,1708.64,is list. I hope you understood what container basically means container basically means
1709.6000000000001,1727.92,"as very clear by its name can contain or you can say have multiple values, multiple values inside."
1727.92,1736.0,Okay. This is the basic meaning of container objects in Python. Now the very first container
1736.0,1740.96,objects in Python is called list. The very first type of container is called as list.
1742.56,1751.12,"See, now list is nothing, list is nothing but you can say a container which is ordered,"
1752.08,1761.12,"a container which is ordered and mutable. Now first understand the meaning of ordered. See,"
1761.9199999999998,1767.6799999999998,"what ordered basically means. Okay, when we go to a library, when we go to a library,"
1767.6799999999998,1775.1999999999998,"all the books are maintained in a proper way, right? You can go to the particular closet and you can"
1775.1999999999998,1780.8799999999999,"get the books because they are all kept in a particular order. Getting my point, in the same way,"
1781.4399999999998,1788.08,the list objects are stored. All the elements are contained in a particular order. The order does
1788.08,1794.3999999999999,"not change. The order is fixed. Okay. Now this is the meaning of ordered, ordered collection of data."
1794.3999999999999,1800.6399999999999,"The second point is mutable. What does mutable means? Mutable simply means, I'll write it here,"
1801.28,1806.6399999999999,changeable. That simply means changeable. Something that can be changed. Okay.
1807.6,1814.1599999999999,"This is understand list by a real life example. We all have used shopping cart, right? Tell me,"
1814.16,1823.3600000000001,"have you have all of you used shopping cart, Amazon cart to keep your items of which I have"
1823.3600000000001,1830.88,"choice, have you kept it? Right? Other people, all of you have used cart, right? Shopping cart,"
1831.6000000000001,1839.76,"Amazon cart, right? Okay. Other people, yes. See, so what happens in those shopping cart?"
1840.64,1846.96,So the shopping cart is like a big container. It is like a list in which there is a particular order.
1846.96,1852.8799999999999,"All the elements are kept one by one. Okay. All the elements are kept one by one, but"
1853.44,1862.64,but the elements of the cart can be added. A new element can be added. Then a new element that
1862.64,1868.16,"has been added can be removed also. You can add any element at any point. Getting my point,"
1869.1200000000001,1876.0,that that means it is ordered also. It is changeable also. It totally depends upon our needs.
1876.0,1881.44,"In what way we want to change the elements of the cart. In the same way, list also works."
1882.16,1889.1200000000001,"List in Python is similar to a cart, Amazon cart, which is ordered. The elements of the list"
1889.1200000000001,1895.44,are ordered and they are mutable also. That means the elements of the list can be changed
1896.16,1903.3600000000001,"depending upon our needs. Okay. Now, let us quickly understand the code. How we write the code for"
1903.3600000000001,1910.16,list? I hope you understood what list basically is. Now you have a basic idea of what list basically is.
1911.92,1917.28,I will get what list basically is so that we can go with the code and when I will be writing
1917.28,1923.68,"the codes, things will be clear to you. Okay guys. I hope that you got a basic idea of what is"
1923.68,1933.92,"list basically is. Okay. It is like a Amazon cart. See, whatever these four things are there,"
1933.92,1940.64,"list, tuple, sit and dictionary. Have a real life example for each one of them. Only then you,"
1941.68,1947.68,Ashish has asked. Okay. Have a real life example for each of them. Only then you can get the
1947.76,1954.4,"concepts clear. Okay. Ashish changeable means changeable means like in your Amazon cart,"
1954.4,1962.5600000000002,"like in your Amazon cart. Yeah. Like updated. Correct. Correct. It is like update, delete. Like you have"
1962.5600000000002,1970.72,"Amazon cart. Right. Now from that Amazon cart, you can add new cloths in the Amazon cart depending"
1970.72,1977.1200000000001,upon your and you can remove the cloths that are already in Amazon cart depending upon your
1977.12,1983.28,"need again. So like update, delete. Correct. Like that is it. You can update your Amazon cart."
1983.28,1989.9199999999998,You can delete some items from the on cart. So this is what made by changeable that it can be
1989.9199999999998,1997.12,changed depending upon our need. The element of the list can be updated depending upon our needs.
1997.12,2004.9599999999998,"The some of the elements can be deleted. Some of the elements can be added. At my point, Ashish,"
2005.68,2011.04,"now if you go to basic idea, what changeable basically means, mutable and changeable."
2013.2,2021.44,Yes. Okay. Okay. Now this is the basic syntax for list. Okay. How see this is a we use
2021.44,2028.48,square brackets. Square brackets is a basic syntax for list. Now you can store multiple elements of
2028.48,2037.52,"your choice. See in a variable in a variable by default, we store only one element, but in a"
2037.52,2044.64,"list, you can store multiple elements. See one, two, three, four, five, all of them. It is like an array."
2044.64,2052.4,"Guys, if you know what is the array, then it is quite similar to an array. Okay. Now we have stored"
2052.4,2058.88,"multiple elements inside a single variable that goes by the name of list. If I print it,"
2059.44,2068.08,"if I simply write print a, all of my elements will be accessed. Give it a minute. That will execute."
2072.08,2078.2400000000002,Okay. The code has executed now. So this is what basically a list is.
2078.9599999999996,2085.6,Here you can see we are storing multiple elements inside a container. What is the container?
2085.6,2090.8799999999997,"Just understand this square brackets as a container and inside the container, we have different"
2090.8799999999997,2096.7999999999997,"elements. One is an element, two is an element and now what we can do is see if I write here,"
2096.8,2114.6400000000003,"if I write here print, then type of e and run this. It is showed that it belongs to the class of"
2114.6400000000003,2121.6000000000004,"list containers. Correct. If I try to access the type, then it belongs to a type of list container."
2122.3199999999997,2129.44,"Now, as she was asking me, what is changeable? Now, see, I will change something. Yeah, a container is"
2129.44,2134.4,"like card. Amazon card, you can take any card of your example, which you can change at any point of"
2134.4,2140.16,"time. The elements can be changed at any point of time depending upon our needs. Now, as she was"
2140.16,2150.56,"asking me, how changeable? As she see, how I am changing? Okay. Okay. I have written a statement."
2151.12,2158.72,"Align of code. Now, focus here. Okay. Does someone here know what is indexing? Index."
2159.7599999999998,2165.12,Index starts from 0 or 1. Is there anyone who knows? Index starts from 0 or 1. 0.
2165.7599999999998,2171.2799999999997,Right. Good. Indexing starts from 0. Okay. Correct. A lot of people know already.
2171.2799999999997,2177.6,"If the people who do not know, I see that most of you guys know, but for the people who do not,"
2177.6,2186.16,just understand that indexing is a way to access the elements from any particular data and indexing
2186.16,2194.08,"starts from 0. See, for this, the index, for the first element, the index is 0, for 2, the index is"
2194.08,2200.48,"1 and then so on. This should be 2, this should be 3 and this should be 4. Okay. So, the indexing"
2200.56,2210.72,"always starts from 0. Now, if I write here, A 2, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. If I only write this,"
2211.44,2219.44,"if I only write this, this is my entire list and if I am accessing the element at index 2,"
2219.44,2225.52,"this is how you access the element at index 2. Now, tell me what is index for this?"
2226.48,2230.32,Can you tell me what can be the index for this? What is the value for this? Sorry.
2230.96,2241.44,What this index? What will be the value?
2241.6,2261.76,"3. Everyone agrees with 3, right? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I see a lot of responses. Okay. So, you're"
2261.76,2269.2000000000003,"correct. The value is 3, only if I run this. If I run this, see, we are able to phase the value of"
2269.4399999999996,2277.2,"3 by indexing because at 0th index, one was there, at first index 2 was there and at third index,"
2281.12,2290.96,"3 was there. Okay. 0, 1 and 2. Now, now I'll do one thing. Now, ask me one question. How changeable?"
2291.84,2300.8,"See, as is here, if I am changing the element at index 2, previously the element was 3, right?"
2300.8,2306.64,"Previously, what we gave? The element was 3. Now, I'm changing the value from 3 to 100."
2307.6,2313.92,"Now, I'm changing the value from 3 to 100. The index will be same, but the element value will be"
2313.92,2322.4,"changed. See, if I run this, right here, if I run this, right to visualize this. Now, the value was"
2322.4,2329.44,"there. See, what the previous value? Now, the value of 3 has been changed to 100. See, how the"
2329.44,2334.96,"list is getting changed? How the elements are getting changed? You can update, delete any value"
2334.96,2342.2400000000002,"depending upon your need. This is the way, this is the reason why I call list as an ordered and"
2342.24,2348.7999999999997,"mutable. Now, now again, now again, why ordered? Now, you have to get into an"
2348.7999999999997,2353.8399999999997,understanding by a small example. Why a list is called mutable and changeable? Did you got a
2353.8399999999997,2360.3999999999996,"basic idea? Other people, did you get a basic idea? Why you are calling list as mutable?"
2362.64,2368.64,"Yes, okay. Okay. Okay. From here, we can know that list is mutable or changeable. Now,"
2369.2,2373.3599999999997,let's quickly understand how am I calling list as an ordered collection of data.
2374.4,2381.52,"Every time, see, I have stored the elements 1, 2, 3 and 5, 4, 5 years, okay. Every time I run this,"
2382.4,2389.44,"every time I run this, you will get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and only. It will not be like 3, 2, 4, 1. It"
2389.44,2395.44,"will be not be like 5, 4, 1, 2. Every time, there will be CModels. See, if I run this 2, 3, 2,"
2395.44,2401.12,"times 3, times 4, times 5 times, every time my output will be CM, it will not change."
2402.0,2408.08,"So, this is what is meant by ordered. The order, the order of data is preserved inside list."
2408.7200000000003,2415.84,"In whatever order you are entering the elements, the output will be CM in the same order."
2415.84,2422.0,"The order will not change. That is what is meant by ordered collection of data. That means,"
2422.0,2428.08,"in whatever way you are entering the inputs, in the CM way, you will be getting the outputs."
2428.08,2433.92,"The order is, see, every time I run this, the order is not changing, okay. This is the basic"
2433.92,2441.92,"meaning of list. Okay. Now, let's just write a few more codes and list and see what are"
2442.4,2448.16,"further operations that we can perform in list. Okay. Now, let's just create a new variable"
2448.3999999999996,2455.12,"by the new response. Okay. Inside this is a list. Okay. Inside the list, we will store,"
2455.12,2470.56,"let's name some games, click it. Then we can have barb and then, good ball. Then you can say,"
2470.72,2480.7999999999997,"chess and one more game, let's give them a hop. Okay. Now, this is our list. This is our list."
2482.56,2488.72,"We'll execute this. We get an output. Okay. You can create any list of your choice. Guys,"
2488.72,2494.0,"side by side do one thing. Create any list of your choice. Now, simply, what I'll access is"
2494.0,2500.96,"some elements to show you guys again the use of indexing. If I write here, if I write here"
2502.08,2508.08,"four, tell me what will be the output now. Guys, if I write here four, what will be the output?"
2508.08,2515.28,You will think indexing. What can be the output for this? If I write here a sport and try to
2515.28,2523.76,"access the element at fourth index, I'm only saying hockey. What other people? Jelpa hockey too,"
2523.76,2530.48,"okay. Other people, I hope everyone agrees that the output will be hockey, right? Yeah,"
2530.48,2536.2400000000002,"Meita, Suri, good. The output will be hockey only because I'm trying to access the element at"
2536.2400000000002,2548.0,"index four. This is the way indexing works. Okay. Now, this is called as positive indexing."
2548.0,2555.04,"This is called as positive indexing. Okay. See, what I'll do is I'll give a good amount of time"
2555.04,2560.32,"for this because this is very, very important and from list only you will understand how tupper"
2560.32,2568.56,"works. Okay. Now, this is called as positive indexing. You can access any elements using positive"
2568.56,2574.64,"indexing from your list. Now, in the list only, in the list only, there is something called as,"
2575.3599999999997,2581.6,"okay, one thing, one thing, one thing more. If I write here is seven, no. If I write here,"
2581.6,2589.8399999999997,"plain sports and then if I write here seven, tell me. What will be the output? Now, if I write this,"
2590.56,2595.3599999999997,"the index is okay, but now tell me will be getting output or will be getting error."
2595.44,2607.44,"Think for a minute error, error, right? Why error? Why error? Anything can even give me a reason why"
2607.44,2614.56,"you will get an error? Any small reason? Three, three, four words reason. Why you will get an error?"
2615.44,2617.1200000000003,Yeah. Good. I wish. Good.
2617.92,2618.72,Good.
2620.88,2627.68,"List index out of range, correct? Because they are not eight elements in our list. They are only five"
2627.68,2634.7999999999997,"elements. Yeah, correct. Correct. There are only, categorize the correct. They are only, we have"
2634.7999999999997,2640.56,only specified five elements in the list and we are trying to access the each element. If there
2640.56,2645.92,"would have been eight elements, then it would be an okay. Unwork, good morning. You're a bit late"
2646.0,2653.36,"on over today. Okay. Nareesh, I'll tell you. Nareesh, okay, no issues. Unwork, try to focus on."
2653.36,2657.28,"Now we just started with list. Nareesh, I'll tell you just wait for a few minutes. Nareesh,"
2657.28,2661.92,"have some patience, have some patience. I'll tell every single thing in detail. Okay, I'm taking"
2661.92,2668.64,"with time-priced things. Okay. Now, this okay, but unworked no issues. Unworked no issues. We just"
2668.64,2674.08,"started with list. Now focus what is list exactly is. Remember, okay? We just started with list."
2674.48,2681.92,"Okay. Now, okay, Rajesh, you two very good morning to you. Rajesh, very good morning."
2682.96,2689.92,"Now, understand, if now I think you understood what positive indexing is. There is something called"
2689.92,2699.44,"as negative indexing to negative indexing. Now, and positive indexing, when I do starts from"
2700.16,2709.52,"starts from zero. Now, negative indexing starts from, right? Is there anyone who knows"
2710.32,2716.32,"negative indexing starts from which value? Negative indexing starts from other people,"
2717.6,2723.28,"minus one light, negative indexing starts from minus exactly correct."
2724.2400000000002,2731.6000000000004,"Now, you can access the elements of list using negative indexing to it is totally up to you,"
2731.6000000000004,2742.48,"which way you want to access. If I write here, print sports minus three. Tell me, what will be the"
2742.48,2755.12,"output? Let me let me bring it a bit here. Let me just click on this, bring it down so that"
2755.12,2758.16,"every single time, why is it all able to use analysis?"
2762.48,2769.92,"Thought we will be put ball, right? Put ball, the people do you guys agree that we put ball only,"
2772.48,2776.8,"the people I hope you guys agree. And how it is working? For example, who do not know what is"
2776.8,2783.44,"negative indexing? See, negative indexing starts from minus one. See positive indexing started from"
2783.44,2788.96,"here, right? Positive indexing started from here. Negative indexing starts from the last."
2789.68,2795.2,"From the last, it will be minus one, the very first index is minus one, then minus two, then"
2795.2,2802.16,"minus three, then minus four, then minus five and so on. So negative indexing starts from the"
2802.16,2810.8799999999997,"last. Now, you can write here from here from last and the first negative index is minus one."
2810.8799999999997,2817.6,"Guys, focus on this positive indexing start from the front and the very first positive index is"
2818.3199999999997,2823.68,positive indexing starts from zero and there is something called as negative indexing.
2824.72,2830.3199999999997,"Inside negative indexing, the process starts from the last of the last, from the end of the"
2830.3199999999997,2838.72,"list and negative indexing starts from minus one. Now, when I run this, when I run this,"
2839.44,2845.44,"my output is put ball, correct? Why is it quickly correct? Now quickly move on to the next line."
2846.4,2855.84,"If I write here, n is equal to, if I use length function here, it will tell me the entire length,"
2857.84,2869.2000000000003,"I write, print, n, that it will tell me the length of the list,"
2869.2,2875.9199999999996,simple length function is used to tell me the length of the list.
2878.56,2882.7999999999997,"Now, we will move on to the next line, simply simple length function."
2882.8,2901.28,"Now, inside list, a very important concept is going, we are going to learn that is slicing,"
2901.92,2908.2400000000002,"very, very important concept, very, very important, how to slice an index, how to slice an index."
2908.8799999999997,2917.52,"See, okay, there was someone who was asking, there was someone who was asking me regarding"
2917.52,2923.2,"updation and deletion. Yeah, narrations there, narrations there. Okay, narrations, for that,"
2923.2,2927.9199999999996,"narrations, for that we have something called as append function, yeah, you are asking,"
2927.9199999999996,2935.04,"right? We write it for you, okay, then we will start with slice, okay. We write it for you."
2935.84,2944.4,"Append function is used for adding an element, adding an element, that element will be added at"
2944.4,2950.96,"the end of the list, by default, it will be added at the end of the list. This is for adding an"
2950.96,2961.68,"element, then we have something called as pop, okay. Pop element is used to, pop is basically used"
2962.16,2970.48,"to remove an element, okay. And by default, the end, end element will be removed, okay."
2971.3599999999997,2984.3999999999996,"By default, we write it for you. By default, last element will be removed."
2984.3999999999996,2990.7999999999997,"And inside pop, you can give any index of a choice and that element can be removed, okay."
2990.8,2996.88,"By default, the last element gets removed and but you can specify any index and you can"
2996.88,3004.6400000000003,"remove that index value also. Okay, Akhand is asking me 15th line, Akhand, okay. Akhand Akhand Akhand"
3004.6400000000003,3009.76,"Akhand, you're asking me 15th line, Akhand 15th line is there is nothing. I just told you about"
3009.76,3015.52,length function. This is length function. What length function does it tell to the entire length
3016.0,3022.4,"of your list? See, understand there are five elements there, right. So this is nothing. This length"
3022.4,3028.32,"function tells you the length of your entire list, okay. Akhand, I just painted the length."
3030.24,3037.36,"Yeah, I'm already saying last element is removed first, correct? And we're using pop, the last"
3037.36,3043.36,"element is removed first by default, but it is correct. If you click correct, by default, it happens"
3043.92,3050.0,"but you can also specify the index value inside pop and that element will be removed, okay."
3050.96,3060.32,"We also have something called as removed. Okay, now what? Yeah, I'll give Ashish first,"
3060.32,3066.2400000000002,"I'm just telling the the functions name and the uses. I'll write the code for each one of them,"
3066.2400000000002,3072.48,"okay. Ashish, no need to worry. You know, I'll tell Jelpa Jelpa Jelpa Jelpa Jelpa Jelpa Jelpa Jelpa"
3073.2,3079.6,"first, let me tell the uses of all the function in, okay. Now remove, remove function, we have"
3079.6,3093.84,"something called as remove function and remove function is used to directly remove or delete any value,"
3094.48,3105.36,"delete any value, okay. This time not by indexing, but by its actual value, like if you want to remove"
3105.36,3110.32,"cricket, then you have to write remove cricket. You should not write remove one, remove CEO,"
3110.32,3116.32,"you should write remove cricket by its value, remove that this slide difference between pop and"
3116.32,3123.84,"remove, okay. This is the main difference between pop and remove, okay. Pop remove the values by"
3123.84,3132.1600000000003,"indexing, while remove will simply delete the element by its actual value, okay. This is the basic"
3132.1600000000003,3140.7200000000003,difference between remove and pop because you might confuse at times that using pop and remove
3141.2799999999997,3146.8799999999997,"the exact thing is getting run, but the main difference comes where the main difference comes"
3147.68,3154.24,"in pop, you use the indexing, you can use the indexing in pop while remove, while using remove,"
3154.24,3162.16,"you can directly remove the values, okay, by its value not by index, okay. Yeah, I wish yeah,"
3163.12,3168.56,"now yeah, I wish now let us understand by his small example,"
3171.68,3180.96,"I just give me a minute, give me a minute, I do not know why it is not saving automatically."
3192.7999999999997,3194.16,"Okay,"
3199.6,3207.04,"guys give me a minute, give me a minute, I think those values are not getting a little,"
3207.04,3209.44,"let me change it, guys give me change it."
3223.12,3224.64,"Okay, okay, give me a minute,"
3229.7599999999998,3231.7599999999998,okay.
3246.3199999999997,3250.0,"I hope my skin is visible to you guys, I hope my skin is visible now."
3252.8799999999997,3259.92,"Everyone, I hope you are able to see my skin, okay, meta, no, meta, now it should be visible, okay,"
3259.92,3267.68,"now it should be visible. There was a special regarding collab, that I was trying to fix, okay, see."
3268.7999999999997,3274.56,"Let us just understand the uses, not yet, not yet meta, are you not able to see my skin meta,"
3275.6,3280.8799999999997,"you should be able to, you should be able to see, meta kindly check once again, okay, yes,"
3282.16,3287.68,"so if someone asks you what is the basic difference between pop and remove,"
3287.68,3296.56,"we will simply say that pop function is used to remove the values by the index, by the index,"
3297.6,3305.52,"while the remove function is used to directly remove or delete any value by its actual value,"
3305.52,3314.72,"not by index, but by its actual value. Now let us quickly understand how you append some values,"
3314.72,3322.8,"first we will be doing the first, first, first function, okay, that is append, okay, now if I write,"
3323.52,3333.36,"write here, sports.append inside this, I'll write maybe a new sport name, let's just"
3333.44,3341.2000000000003,"name the name should be basketball, okay, and it means basketball, and now see, by default if I"
3341.2000000000003,3353.6,"run this, then sports, okay, if I'm running this, see, a new element is added and by default it gets"
3353.6,3361.6800000000003,"added at the end of the list, okay, by default it gets added at the end of the list, okay,"
3361.8399999999997,3370.0,"you guys getting understanding the user of it append function, the very first function that I told you,"
3370.0,3377.2,"append function is used for adding an element, and by default that element gets added at the end"
3377.2,3383.2799999999997,"of the list, see at the end of the list after hockey, the element got added at the basket wall, okay,"
3383.36,3391.84,"now, now what we can do is, here, now we'll learn about pop, okay, now let's then,"
3392.5600000000004,3406.1600000000003,"I hope you guys were able to understand what is append function, guys, okay, okay,"
3406.16,3413.12,"okay, got it,"
3423.7599999999998,3426.64,"now one more thing, one more thing, I want to add one more thing,"
3427.12,3440.48,"now first learn about pop now, if I write here sports dot pop, I just write this, I'm just writing"
3440.48,3452.0,"this and I print this sports, run this, see, by default using pop, the last element that was added,"
3452.0,3459.68,"that was basket ball, it got removed, by default, by default what happens, the last value get"
3459.68,3466.72,"removed, I told you right, pop is used to remove an element, and by default last element will be"
3466.72,3474.48,"removed, correct, the last element was what, basket ball, correct, this is a simple use of pop,"
3474.48,3479.2,"inside pop, you can give indexing also, now we'll get index, we'll give index also,"
3479.8399999999997,3487.68,"but understand that by default, the last values get removed, if you do not specify any index,"
3487.68,3495.4399999999996,"then the last value will be removed, okay, now we will specify some index and see how we can"
3495.4399999999996,3502.3999999999996,"specify indexing in pop, where I tell sports dot pop, and if I want to remove the badminton,"
3503.2000000000003,3514.2400000000002,"I'll write here one, and if I write here sports again, I run this, see, if able to visualize this,"
3515.52,3525.76,"this is where we use indexing, okay, I'll repeat again, I'll repeat again,"
3525.84,3534.0,"see, what happens, I hope you guys were able to understand, append, append function is used for"
3534.0,3539.2000000000003,"adding an element, and by default that elements get added at the end of the page, okay,"
3539.2000000000003,3544.32,"well, we were able to get good, good, for the people who are not getting a, I'm repeating again,"
3544.96,3552.5600000000004,"for by using pop function, pop function deletes an element, and by default that element is deleted"
3552.64,3558.0,"from the end of the list, you're able to see the last element was basket ball, and it got removed"
3558.0,3566.0,"from the list, and now inside pop, you can also use indexing also, you can delete the elements"
3566.0,3573.6,"by using their index, here I deleted the element at index one, at index one, what was the element"
3573.6,3581.52,"that was present, it was badminton, zero and one, so I removed the badminton element using indexing,"
3581.52,3587.12,"that too by using pop function, okay, are the people, are you guys are able to do it, getting it,"
3588.4,3592.8,"what is use of append and pop function, yes, are the people,"
3596.72,3601.44,"okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, I'm asking why are we not using spare bracket,"
3601.44,3607.68,"I'm an, we can directly, I'm an inside pop function, what happens, we can directly give the index"
3607.7599999999998,3613.8399999999997,"value, there is no need to use square brackets, because pop function understands that inside me,"
3613.8399999999997,3620.48,"you will only give indexes nothing else, okay, so we do not need to specify square brackets in pop,"
3622.16,3627.52,"if you will write, then it will give an error, if I write a sports.pop,"
3627.7599999999998,3635.6,"where write here, it might work, but I'll try again, write a sports,"
3638.56,3647.7599999999998,"see, by default it automatically knows, you do not need to override it, okay, you do not need to"
3647.84,3658.1600000000003,"override it, okay, getting my, yeah, correct, correct, normally you can do it by using index inside"
3658.1600000000003,3665.92,"pop, there is no need to use square brackets, now, so when I'm asking, yeah, yeah, yeah,"
3667.1200000000003,3673.6800000000003,"I'm an, for declaring a list, I'm an, for declaring a list, square brackets are compulsory,"
3674.16,3680.56,"this is a basic syntax for declaring a list, square brackets are compulsory,"
3681.9199999999996,3688.96,"now, Ashish is asking, no, Jalpa is asking, can we remove multiple values, okay, Jalpa, this is a"
3688.96,3694.0,"good question, if you want to remove multiple values, you can use a for loop, you can iterate over"
3694.0,3699.6,"all the element, and you can remove every element of your choice, now Ashish is asking,"
3699.6,3705.68,"said if we want to append at second position, okay, Ashish, for that we have a particular function,"
3705.68,3713.44,"which, okay, goes by the name of insert, we have insert also, okay, Ashish, understand what insert"
3713.44,3720.64,"does first, insert also is used for adding an element, insert is also used for adding an element,"
3721.44,3737.12,"but it can be any index, it can be any index of our choice, it can be any index of our choice,"
3737.12,3742.56,"understand, what is the basic difference between append function and insert function, okay,"
3742.56,3749.8399999999997,"append function is used for adding an element, but by default that element will be added at the end"
3749.84,3756.32,"of the list, okay, but insert function is also used for adding an element, but using insert function,"
3756.32,3763.92,"what you can do is, you can add the element at any index of your choice, at any place, if you"
3763.92,3769.92,"want to add the element, you can add it, it is not necessary that it will be added at the end,"
3770.48,3775.44,"you can add at any index of your choice, okay, we will see how to do it, okay, we are going to write"
3775.52,3783.44,"the code for it, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, I hope I addressed your question,"
3783.44,3790.16,"sir, how can we add an element of the choice, okay, okay, okay, okay,"
3790.16,3795.36,"mother, her mccala is asking if duplicate values present, then which element will be removed,"
3795.36,3803.6,"okay, okay, good question, mother mccala, see, if you use remove, if you use remove, then"
3804.16,3809.68,"if there are 10 values that goes by the name of 100, and if you are removing 100, then all the"
3809.68,3815.68,"values will be removed, okay, remove function will remove all the values that are of the same value,"
3816.48,3826.24,"okay, mother mccala getting my point, okay, now, now we will use, we will understand how"
3827.04,3832.7999999999997,"insert function work, will the, I hope this was your question, will the, will the, I hope this"
3832.8,3839.2000000000003,"was your question, how we add and list at a desired index, yes, okay, now we will see how we do it,"
3839.2000000000003,3849.04,"how we actually do it, okay, I will simply write, but let me bring you a sports, okay, this is the"
3849.6000000000004,3855.84,"list that we have now, now what I will do is, I will write a sports dot insert,"
3856.48,3870.1600000000003,"inside this, maybe let us just give any sports name, anything what can we give,"
3872.48,3880.0,"let us just give the name of iSockey, we can give iSockey or anything, just, just, just,"
3880.08,3886.96,"just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just,"
3889.12,3899.12,"okay, where on this and again print the list again, see, what is happening here is,"
3899.68,3907.2,"I am adding the element at index one, before football, cricket is zero index, and before football,"
3907.2799999999997,3912.56,"before it was football that, that was at the first index, now we have added,"
3912.56,3919.4399999999996,"carambuat at the first index, see, I have specified the index and I have added the value,"
3919.4399999999996,3925.6,"getting my point, this is how you can add any element at any index of a choice, inside the list,"
3925.6,3932.48,"okay, getting it, okay, other people, I hope you guys are able to get it, how we can add any"
3933.28,3939.92,"element at any index of a choice, guys, try to do it in your courts also, in your peaches also,"
3939.92,3946.64,"try to do it, Syruthan, Syruthan, okay, Syruthan, no, no, no, Syruthan, you can use"
3946.64,3952.16,"follow for the same, but if you want to use multiple values with insert only, then you have to use"
3952.16,3958.8,"insert multiple times, see, at one time you can specify only one index, okay, Syruthan, at one"
3959.04,3964.48,"time you can specify only one index, and one specific value, if you want to add multiple indexes,"
3964.48,3970.7200000000003,"it is tough to do it, okay, now, guys, let us quickly move on to slicing now, slicing is a very"
3970.7200000000003,3976.0800000000004,"big concept and very, very important, I do not want to miss that, okay, quickly move to slicing,"
3976.88,3982.8,"these were the basic functions, append, insert, then pop and remove, okay, now quickly move on"
3982.8,3987.84,"to slicing, if you do not want to use slicing, slicing is very, very important, a lot of people"
3988.6400000000003,3999.44,"confusion slicing, okay, see, let us quickly have our print or list first, this is all list,"
3999.44,4004.2400000000002,"which has six elements, okay, which is, no, no, five elements are there, right, five elements,"
4004.96,4012.48,"okay, now, with slicing what we do is, with slicing what we do is, we access few particular"
4012.48,4017.84,"elements from the list, we will access few particular elements from the list, okay,"
4019.44,4025.92,"sure, I usually say, okay, okay, okay, got it, got it, I used, okay, okay, now, understand what"
4025.92,4031.28,"slicing basically means, and I used your code is also cut cut cut, got it, I used your code is,"
4031.28,4037.68,"okay, now understand what slicing basically does, slicing basically, see, now, I use what is"
4037.7599999999998,4043.12,"happening in your code is, both the elements are getting added at the one and one index only, okay,"
4043.7599999999998,4050.56,"now, your code is correct, now understand slicing first, see, what, what we actually accomplish"
4050.56,4057.6,"using slicing is that, we can access few particular elements from the list, what we can actually"
4058.16,4065.04,"do using slicing is, we can access few particular elements from the old list or for choice,"
4065.04,4071.2,"let's just implement slicing quickly, if I write here sports, if I write here sports,"
4072.08,4081.44,"and if I write here zero and two, four or three, anything, see, the very first one is,"
4081.44,4085.04,"I will comment and write here, the very first one is, start index,"
4087.04,4092.88,"then something called stop index, and there is also something that is called as step,"
4093.76,4099.6,"remove step, remove step, do not talk about step first, first we will talk about start and stop index,"
4099.6,4106.72,"what is start and stop index, see, now if I run this, if I run this, if I write here sports here,"
4106.72,4113.52,"if I run this, much more, try to three,"
4123.4400000000005,4128.96,"create a more, all the elements are getting access, it should stop, wait,"
4130.32,4131.6,"we try changing the values,"
4137.6,4145.4400000000005,"well let's write one, okay, now it is working fine, where I take two,"
4147.4400000000005,4150.96,"it is working fine again, okay, now it is working fine,"
4151.12,4158.0,"now it is working fine, see, what we did was, we accessed few particular elements,"
4158.0,4163.76,"and what was those elements, we accessed zero as element first, and the one index,"
4163.76,4169.44,"we skipped two, when we write here two, it will run till three, if I write here sports,"
4171.12,4180.88,"zero and three, then this come on, see, zero as element, first index element, and second"
4180.88,4189.12,"index element, it will run, it will go to till and minus one, it will run till start in two"
4189.12,4195.84,"stop index minus one, see, what we are doing using slicing is, slicing is basically used to"
4195.84,4203.04,"access particular elements from our list, okay, with slicing we are trying to access,"
4203.04,4208.16,"cricket and caram board at the same time, so what I will do is, I will write here square"
4208.96,4215.76,"and put indexes for the same, see, zero, zero is the start index, I have, I have"
4215.76,4225.599999999999,"specified that zero should be my start index, two should be my stop index, and my list should be"
4225.599999999999,4232.88,"appended, I should extract some particular elements, okay, mother, maquilized asking,"
4232.96,4240.0,"so stop index means number of, no, no, okay, okay, understand, stop index, you give n plus one,"
4240.0,4248.64,"okay, if you want to go till n, then you should give stop index as n plus one, okay, if you want to go"
4248.64,4256.64,"till n, then you should give stop index at as n plus one, because it goes till one, less it,"
4257.360000000001,4263.200000000001,"see, if I am, now if I am writing here two, then it will actually run till one, if I am writing"
4263.200000000001,4269.12,"here three, then it will actually print till two, okay, see, here you are getting the elements,"
4269.12,4274.96,"cricket and caram board, not put ball, okay, you are getting cricket that is zero index and caram board"
4274.96,4279.200000000001,"that is one index and not two, that is football, you are not able to get football, if you want to"
4279.28,4285.28,"get football, then you have to write here three, so that it goes zero, one and two, okay,"
4286.88,4294.8,"that is by I wrote here it goes till n minus one, okay, now I is asking can you make sports, sports"
4294.88,4309.76,"zero, zero and four, there are four elements, okay, okay, see, zero element, first index element,"
4309.76,4314.08,"second index element and third index element, now is getting it now,"
4314.96,4324.64,"there is, we are able to access four elements and according to our choices, we are able to"
4324.64,4331.28,"extract the element from the list, okay, this is what we are accomplishing through a start"
4331.28,4337.76,"step, start index and stop index, okay, now also there is something else also, if I write here sports,"
4338.16,4345.04,"yeah, account, account, account, account, account, account, n minus one basically means account,"
4345.04,4352.56,"n minus one basically means that your elements are extracted till n minus one,"
4352.56,4360.16,"if you are writing here three, account, if you are writing here three, then till only this index is"
4360.16,4368.8,"till two are getting accessed, okay, okay, Madanmiklal, okay, I will try, but account, see,"
4368.8,4376.16,"for you draw out the meaning is only the values till two are getting printed, the last value is not"
4376.16,4382.72,"getting printed, see, if I am writing here three, it is only working till two, getting my point,"
4382.72,4390.0,"that is by I wrote n minus one, it is actually going till two only, not three, see, here you wrote two,"
4390.0,4396.24,"but it actually went till one only, okay, that is why I wrote here n minus one, n is the stop index,"
4396.24,4404.72,"that is three, n is running till n minus one, okay, account, okay, account, clear with a doubt,"
4407.6,4413.76,"yeah, yeah, correct, correct, correct, cool, leave, account, but three, but three means what,"
4413.76,4422.96,"okay, yeah, n is the number of, yeah, I should write that, I should write that, okay, account,"
4422.96,4430.8,"can you please tell me, but three means what, but three, if you spy a doubt, okay,"
4430.8,4446.08,"till then I will write mother macaws out, by I tier five, sports comma three,"
4449.04,4457.84,"what is that account sports comma three, didn't get it, okay, account, account, see, I will"
4457.84,4464.8,"write again, in case you are not getting it, see, what happens, basically is, what happens,"
4464.8,4471.04,"your index value is starting from here, and it is going to n minus one, n is three,"
4471.04,4475.6,"but it will not go to three, it will go to two only, it will print the elements till,"
4477.12,4482.24,"index two only, it will not print the element at index three, that is why, see,"
4482.88,4489.04,"cricket was the first index, caram was the second, see cricket was the zeroes index,"
4489.04,4495.36,"caram was at the first index, football was at the second element, right index, now when I printed,"
4495.36,4503.12,"sports zero, colon two, it printed zeroes index and first index only, it did not print in the"
4503.12,4510.08,"second index, okay, that is why I am writing n minus one, n is two here, and I'm, and my list is"
4510.16,4516.16,"going till one only, it is not going to two, that is why I'm writing here, n minus one, n is the"
4516.16,4522.32,"end and index, and it is going to n minus one, understand, okay, good, now, mother maquilla, you are"
4522.32,4529.04,"asking, mother maquilla, it is that question, can you try four, four, okay, mother maquilla,"
4529.04,4536.0,"try it, and see, it is starting at four, and it is ending also, that is why we are not able to"
4536.0,4542.08,"get any output, okay, because starting and index, starting and ending are theme, now,"
4542.64,4555.04,"bridges is asking to write sports, sports two and four, okay, see, visualize this,"
4555.68,4559.76,"I'm an, I'll try, I'm an, I'll try, I'm an, I'll try, just give me a minute, I'll take one"
4559.84,4567.52,"and out, okay, but Jason is asking me, yeah, but Jason is asking me from two till three, see,"
4567.52,4573.2,"where is my, let me quickly bring my sports first, wait, I have what I'll do is,"
4579.2,4585.52,"first I'll print sports first, so that I'm able to visualize it, okay, sports is here, now,"
4585.6,4591.52,"now bridges you're asking me, two and colon four, so zero at index, first index, second index,"
4591.52,4598.4800000000005,"second index, second index is put ball, and it will not run till food, it will run till three,"
4598.4800000000005,4604.0,"so only put ball and chest is getting executed, okay, clear bridges,"
4605.280000000001,4609.76,"bridges, I hope it is clear, that is why we are getting only put ball and chest,"
4610.08,4616.56,"bridges, now, we'll take one more, we'll take one more and then we'll move on, okay,"
4616.56,4623.360000000001,"Amani is asking, try zero, okay Aman, but we do not have that much values, right, Aman,"
4623.360000000001,4635.84,"we do not have that much values, but no issues, I'll learn it, see, why, because it is now running till,"
4636.4800000000005,4642.96,"it is now running till all the elements, it is now executing all the elements, see understand,"
4642.96,4650.4800000000005,"stop basically how, stop is basically functioning, stop is running till last, stop is trying to run"
4650.4800000000005,4658.400000000001,"till last, now, if I add two more elements here, or if I remove two three elements, even then"
4658.4,4665.679999999999,"all of my elements will be printed, okay, stop basically means to till here, till here, start"
4665.679999999999,4672.719999999999,"from zero, until here, whatever elements you get, execute all of them, this is the basic use of"
4672.719999999999,4680.799999999999,"stop, it will stop, it will start at zero and it will execute all the elements till seventh index,"
4680.799999999999,4685.04,"if there are any elements, then it will execute all of them, okay Amani,"
4685.28,4694.08,"if, but if there is ninth element, then it will not execute it, if there is ninth element, then it will not execute it,"
4694.08,4701.04,"okay, this is the basic meaning of stop, till it will start at zero and add six index, okay,"
4702.0,4712.96,"okay, if you try four five, okay, if you try sports, four five, okay, and run this, see, okay,"
4712.96,4723.68,"madden mackila, okay, leave it out, madden mackila is there, okay, getting it, why we are getting"
4723.84,4731.52,"hockey, okay, good, okay, now quickly move forward and now we will understand negative indexing also,"
4731.52,4743.84,"you have to understand negative indexing this, one more question we can take here, one small question,"
4744.4800000000005,4754.0,"where it is sports, I do not specify any start index, I will write here four, see this,"
4755.84,4763.76,"I am not specify any start index directly, I am writing colon four, what can be the output now,"
4763.76,4769.360000000001,"guys, what can be the output, I am not specifying any start index directly, I am running my"
4769.36,4779.679999999999,"hotel four, what can be the output, okay, I use your saying last four values or starting four values,"
4780.5599999999995,4786.48,"this thing for me last four values are starting four values, what can be the output, last four values are"
4786.48,4798.4,"starting four values, last sure, yeah, it will be, okay, no issues, I use no issues, we are all learning,"
4798.4,4804.5599999999995,"right, no issues, it will be starting four values, it will not be last four values, correct,"
4804.5599999999995,4810.16,"another, it will be starting four values, because we have not specified any start index,"
4810.16,4816.4,"but we have told, but we have told that this is policy indexing, understand, this is positive indexing,"
4816.4,4823.12,"it always starts from this starting, negative indexing starts from then, okay, negative indexing"
4823.2,4828.4,"start from then, okay, okay, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, I will tell that, see,"
4830.48,4837.84,"what basically happens is that it is starting from zero to index only and running till the third index,"
4837.84,4843.68,"okay, and the code is executing till the third element to the third index, that is why we are getting"
4843.68,4851.36,"four elements at the output, okay, this is a basic flow, all of you remember that positive indexing"
4851.599999999999,4856.24,"start from the first and negative indexing start from the end, this is very, very important,"
4856.799999999999,4861.28,"now, basically short this out and mother, mother, mother, mother, what if we write two, okay,"
4861.28,4870.88,"I will take it out, no issues, I will write here two, I am print this, see, visualize this, visualize this,"
4873.04,4878.24,"this was my port list, okay, this was my port list, okay, what is happening is, it will start from"
4878.24,4884.4,"the second index, it will start from the second index, that is, football, and it will print all"
4884.4,4889.599999999999,"the elements that are after football, if we add four five elements after hockey also, right,"
4889.599999999999,4895.76,"it will print all the four five elements also, after hockey also, that means it will start at two,"
4896.32,4903.44,"and if we have not specified any in any in index, then it will print whatever elements comes"
4903.5199999999995,4911.679999999999,"after hockey also, it can print n values, okay, this is a basic flow of not specifying start and stop index,"
4911.679999999999,4920.08,"okay, now one more question comes to mind, one more question comes to my mind, if I write here"
4920.8,4929.5199999999995,"here, print 0 and nothing, what is the output now, what is the output now,"
4930.48,4942.0,"in per minute, all, all other people, other people, only start index, no stop index, correct,"
4942.96,4956.48,"see, see, because I have not written print here, now all of my elements will be accessed,"
4957.68,4963.6,"now all of my elements will be accessed, simply all because it is starting from 0,"
4963.6,4971.68,"and I have not specified any in stop index, so, okay,"
4980.56,4986.88,"Ashish, if, able to see this, Ashish, are you able to visualize this, you wanted to meet"
4987.04,4996.56,"you on this side, able to visualize it, okay, good, see, you can have multiple questions in your mind,"
4998.4800000000005,5001.84,"now one more thing, now one more very important topic,"
5006.24,5012.0,"without print, okay, Madan Makhila, directly you are accessing the values, if you write here,"
5012.08,5017.52,"E is equal to 10, E is equal to 10, you can simply write A also, and you get the output, right,"
5017.52,5021.84,"you simply write A is equal to 10, you get the output, in the same way it is functioning,"
5021.84,5025.92,"you not need to write the print, it means every single time, okay,"
5027.12,5031.12,"directly you can access the values also, if you write A is equal to 10, if I am not writing"
5031.12,5035.28,"the print here, directly I am writing A and I am able to access the value at 10, in five"
5035.36,5042.32,"index, okay, now one more important concept here, we learnt about start index, start index,"
5043.04,5049.28,"then we learnt about stop index, but there is one more concept that is step,"
5050.48,5055.599999999999,"there is, it is step, start index, stop index, and then something called step size,"
5056.4800000000005,5067.280000000001,"okay, understand what is step, if I write here sports, first print sports, first we will check"
5067.280000000001,5074.8,"for sports, print the list, okay, these are the elements in our list, now, okay,"
5074.8,5080.160000000001,"I am very asking line 38 one more time, okay, and where, okay, and where, what it, see,"
5080.24,5085.84,"and where this was someone's doubt, Ashid was asking, if we do not specify any start index,"
5087.04,5092.88,"or if we are not specifying any stop index, then all of my element will be get printed,"
5092.88,5098.72,"because we have not specified anything, because we have not told that, I, okay, there are 10 people"
5098.72,5104.32,"in a line, okay, let us understand by example, there in a assembly line, there are 10 people, okay,"
5104.4,5111.2,"now, in the 10 people when I say that, I want all the people from the second person to the fifth person,"
5111.2,5116.639999999999,"then I will get second person to fifth person only, now, if I do not specify anything,"
5116.639999999999,5122.4,"what my python is understanding that, I am requesting for all the people, I am requesting for"
5122.4,5128.0,"all the people, because I have not specified anything, so I will, I will give him all the people,"
5128.0,5136.48,"okay, mother, no, mother, maquilla, see, normally what happens, okay, okay, and where, I hope you are"
5136.48,5142.64,"clear, okay, mother, maquilla, what happens, when we do not specify any start index or stop index,"
5142.64,5149.28,"by default, it takes 0 only, okay, there are not specifying any start index, that it will take"
5149.28,5156.56,"the value as 0 only, because index starts on 0 only right, mother, maquilla, if you are not"
5156.56,5162.400000000001,"specifying any indexing, then by default, it takes the value as 0 only, because your indexing start"
5162.400000000001,5170.320000000001,"from 0 right, now, quickly understand, now try to understand the stop, everyone try to focus here,"
5170.320000000001,5177.92,"now, okay, see, there is something called as step size also, we learnt about start index,"
5177.92,5183.120000000001,"we learnt about stop index, but there is something called as step size also, what is step size,"
5183.2,5190.5599999999995,"understand this, if I write here, if I write here sports, and then I write here 0,"
5191.5199999999995,5200.72,"then let us just say 5, but also I write here 2, I am also writing here 2, I execute this,"
5204.24,5211.36,"what is happening here is, from cricket, it is jumping to football, again from football,"
5211.36,5217.28,"it is jumping to hockey, and it is skipping the element that is coming in between, right,"
5217.28,5223.5199999999995,"it is skipping the element that is coming in between, we are only getting cricket, from cricket,"
5223.5199999999995,5228.88,"it is jumping to football, and again from football, it is jumping to hockey, the elements that are"
5228.88,5234.32,"coming in between those that are caramboid and chess, they are getting skipped, this is what we"
5234.32,5240.08,"call as step size, we can skip some particular elements based upon our choices, what if,"
5240.64,5251.76,"what if I write here sports, 0, 5, and 3, try to think of an output now, right, try to think,"
5251.76,5257.12,"just wait for a minute, just think how the step size is working, step size is starting from 0,"
5257.68,5264.16,"starting from 0, and it is going till the fifth index, fourth index, but it is skipping the element"
5264.16,5272.48,"every time see, it was 0, 0, then it is jump to 1, skip 1, it need to jump to second element,"
5272.48,5278.24,"it will jump to second element, and skip caramboid that is coming in between, again from football,"
5278.24,5283.36,"it will jump to second element that is hockey, and it will skip chess, correct,"
5284.72,5291.36,"now if I write here 0, start from 0, end at 5, and step count I have specifies 3,"
5292.0,5296.08,"what can be the output now, what can be the output, other people,"
5297.759999999999,5302.719999999999,"some people sing cricket inches, other people what can be the output now, just think for a minute,"
5304.32,5310.08,"that is same, other people cricket inches, other people I want more responses guys,"
5311.28,5314.5599999999995,"shall I repeat it again, shall I repeat it again, if you want I can repeat,"
5314.64,5321.120000000001,"okay, getting it, okay, okay, okay, and when you are saying repeat, okay, okay,"
5322.080000000001,5328.400000000001,"see and where the thing is add step size is nothing, but we are directly jumping from one element to"
5328.400000000001,5334.8,"other element, see if I am writing here 0, then it will this is the start index that is 0,"
5334.8,5342.080000000001,"that is cricket, now it is stop index is 5, and it will run till 4, right, that is why we got"
5342.08,5349.2,"the elements, okay, now when we are when we are writing here 2, that mean this is the step size,"
5349.2,5354.32,"this is how much steps you need to jump, you need to directly jump from the first layer to the"
5354.32,5360.72,"third is there, you need to and you skip the second stair, right, in the same way this is working,"
5361.44,5367.84,"we are directly jumping from cricket to football, from cricket it will add 2 more elements"
5367.84,5372.96,"and directly jump from cricket to football, and again from football it will jump to hockey,"
5373.6,5377.84,"and skip the element that come in between, this is what is meant by step size,"
5377.84,5384.16,"and I run this, see the output, the output is cricket and chess, folks you are exactly correct,"
5384.16,5389.6,"exactly correct, why cricket and chess, this is because it is starting from the start index,"
5389.6,5397.4400000000005,"that is 0, and at 0 to index cricket is present, and now it is jumping 3 step time,"
5397.44,5402.639999999999,"3 steps from cricket that means, first step is cannon board, second step is football,"
5402.639999999999,5408.96,"and the third step is chess, third step is chess, that is why you are getting the output as cricket,"
5411.599999999999,5418.799999999999,"I use it is not football, it is chess, not football, it is not 2, if I write here 2 then it will be chess,"
5419.36,5426.799999999999,"but I am writing here 3, that is why we are running till chess, chess is correct, cricket and chess,"
5426.8,5432.96,"if I write here 2 then it will go to football, but I am writing here 3, so it will run from cricket,"
5432.96,5439.6,"first it will go to cricket, then jump, first step, second step, and the third step,"
5439.6,5443.76,"third step is what chess, and I spetify here, I want the third step,"
5443.76,5447.92,"waiting my point, and all the elements will in between will get skipped,"
5448.8,5455.2,"waiting my point guys, other people are you are getting it, is there anyone who has doubts,"
5456.16,5464.48,"they can ask if you have any, Madan Makila asking, by default Madan Makila, by default the step count"
5464.48,5471.44,"is one only, understand that Madan Makila by default the steps count is one only,"
5472.08,5480.72,"if I write here your doubt is sports, and 2 then 4 then 1, you are kind of doing this,"
5481.280000000001,5489.04,"ok, visualize this, by default the step count is one, that is why we are getting football"
5489.04,5496.72,"inches, ok, by default the step size is one, that is why we are getting football inches,"
5496.72,5502.96,"directly we are not skipping anything, directly we are getting football land, just no element is getting skipped,"
5503.76,5507.84,"but if you write here 2, but if you write here 2 then the element might get changed,"
5508.4800000000005,5511.84,"because then the default step I will write here, I will write here,"
5512.96,5520.24,"the might, when you are rising you might get it, default step size is one only,"
5522.32,5527.2,"till here I hope it is clear for everyone, let us quickly respond if it is clear till here,"
5527.2,5533.2,"so that we can move forward, clear respond, other people will be saying yes, other people"
5533.2,5542.639999999999,"respond in that section, ok, we have to, I hope it is clear, good, Vignesh, Anwar,"
5542.639999999999,5549.04,"ok, nice, nice, in the same way, in the same way I am implementing positive indexing,"
5549.04,5554.96,"you can implement negative indexing also, both ways are available to you, you can implement both"
5554.96,5561.92,"positive indexing and negative indexing, now I want you guys to implement negative index,"
5562.0,5566.56,"implement because we not have much time, so I want you guys to implement negative indexing also,"
5566.56,5573.2,"if you have any doubts we can take it afterwards, ok, apply, I want you guys to implement negative"
5573.2,5579.12,"indexing, now the same way, now I will move on to tuples, quickly move on tuples, we are already"
5579.12,5588.08,"lagging behind, ok, see tuple, tuple is nothing, tuple is nothing, tuple is again ordered,"
5588.16,5595.28,"it is also container, ordered, but this is immutable, a very important thing, tuple is ordered,"
5595.84,5603.04,"but tuple is immutable, what is immutable that means, all the values will be in the same order,"
5603.6,5609.04,"but if you want to change any element then it is not possible, not changing, I want"
5609.12,5617.04,"completely correct, the values are not changing, if you fix any value at one time,"
5617.04,5624.0,"then that particular value cannot change, ok, let us just understand again my area life example,"
5624.8,5632.32,"let us just say you have the names of month in a year, the names of month in a year, those are fixed"
5632.32,5637.92,"right, those are fixed, you cannot change and very right, if the flow should be January,"
5637.92,5644.24,"February, March, April and so on, so those are fixed, ok, in the same way tuple is working,"
5644.24,5651.52,"there is a particular order, after January, February will come, then March will come, then April will come,"
5651.52,5656.96,"in the same way tuple also works, there is a particular order like list, the elements are in the"
5658.0,5665.36,"in the same order, but, but they are not changeable, you cannot change it, like we were changing list,"
5665.36,5670.799999999999,"we cannot change in tuple, just in a minute you will be able to see, tuple is,"
5672.0,5683.5199999999995,"let us give some name give it B, it is done using this brackets inside it, I will write"
5684.080000000001,5695.84,"1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, ok, you clear on this, see if I run this again and again, if I run this again"
5695.84,5702.72,"and again, the values are not changing, that mean the tuple is, that mean the tuple is what,"
5703.360000000001,5711.76,"tuple is what, tuple is ordered, every time I run this, the values are still the same,"
5711.76,5715.68,"the values are still the same, the output is still the same, it is not changing, that is why we"
5715.68,5724.72,"call it as ordered, now why it is called as immutable, immutable is if I write here, if I write here,"
5726.320000000001,5734.64,"tuple our B and inside it if I want to change some element, in the list we change element"
5734.64,5738.16,"like this, right and if I write here 100, the same operation I am trying to omit,"
5739.12,5746.0,"now I am trying to change the element, if I run this, see, able to see this,"
5746.0,5751.76,"they saying tuple of it does not support iton assignment, that means, the items are not"
5751.76,5757.2,"changeable, the items cannot be changed, whatever you assign, once to the tuple that particular"
5757.2,5764.24,"values cannot change, what I am saying, narrish, but this is not a narrish, this is how you"
5764.32,5770.08,"implement indexing, right, this is how you implement indexing, yeah, yeah, yeah, narrish, it is"
5770.08,5777.599999999999,"similar, narrish, it is similar, but the most important thing is that the your elements cannot be"
5777.599999999999,5785.04,"changed, okay, madamekila does it allowed good question, good good good question, if I write here,"
5785.04,5793.679999999999,"if I it is C is equal to 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, also you can also have"
5794.32,5803.36,"any elements of it choice, okay, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, I am taking multiple times, if I print this,"
5805.92,5814.24,"well to say it, madamekila, so I will write here once more observation, both list and tuple allow"
5814.24,5824.16,"duplicates also, both list and tuple you can have duplicates also, getting it, madamekila"
5824.48,5831.5199999999995,"I hope you are able to get this, okay, madamekila getting it, calling it as narrish, okay,"
5832.5599999999995,5839.599999999999,"you can have duplicates in both list and tuples, okay, both list and tuples allow to,"
5840.4,5847.28,"yeah, both allows to duplicates, it is up to you what you want, okay, getting this madamekila,"
5848.24,5855.04,"okay, okay, nice, so if anyone asks you what is the main difference between these two container"
5855.04,5861.04,"objects that are list and tuple, so they all work in the same way, but the main difference is"
5861.84,5868.96,"both are ordered list and tuple both are ordered, but the main difference is that list is"
5868.96,5876.4,"mutable and order and tuple is immutable, for your reference I will give, I will write the"
5876.4,5886.0,"examples also, list is like a shopping cart, list is like a shopping cart, okay, okay,"
5886.0,5891.839999999999,"is there any certain type to include or we can use a vignis good question, good question,"
5891.839999999999,5895.92,"vignis I will show it to you, vignis I will quickly show it, if you write here,"
5896.32,5907.68,"your name, your name is vignis, right, vignis this giving some 60 element, after this you are"
5907.68,5915.84,"giving some, this their type, after this you are giving some float values, after this you are"
5915.84,5925.36,"giving some duplicate values again 60, and now you and you run this, see the output,"
5926.08,5933.52,"vignis, vignis able to see the output, you are getting string values also, you are getting"
5934.64,5940.0,"integer values also, then you are getting, if you are getting values also, you are able to see"
5941.28,5946.72,"float, float values also, then you are also able to see duplicates, okay vignis, I hope it"
5946.72,5954.08,"works fine for you, getting it now vignis, okay, now I will come back to this, I will write the"
5954.08,5961.04,"example again, what list is like a shopping cart, and tuple is like, let us say months in a year,"
5962.0,5969.5199999999995,"months in a year, or you can take one more example of a tefin box, okay, when we used to go to"
5969.5199999999995,5973.44,"schools, right, when you used to school, our mother's or family member, they used to give us"
5973.44,5981.76,"tefin box, right, so when you get some elements in the tefin box and you take it to your school,"
5981.76,5986.16,"something is good for you, right, and you took it to your school, so the elements of the tefin"
5986.16,5991.12,"work are not changing, right, so the elements are fixed, in the same way, tuple also works,"
5991.12,5996.16,"whatever element you contain inside a tuple, they are fixed, they are in the same order,"
5996.16,6005.68,"but those are immutable, the elements of the tefin or the elements, right, like months in a year,"
6005.68,6012.88,"are not changing, right, this is why we called as tuple as immutable, now, now quickly I will move"
6012.88,6018.72,"one to set index, we can perform different operations like you are performing in list, you can"
6018.72,6025.04,"perform in tuple also, now perform operation, now quickly you guys can do it, because I"
6025.04,6030.88,"specify most of the operation list only, and both are quite similar, perform operations"
6031.6,6039.92,"like list in tuples, okay, you guys can try and you will be able to get the concept, but the main"
6039.92,6046.8,"difference is that tuple is immutable, we will move one to set and index and you also quickly"
6046.8,6054.08,"will take some time, because we also have to call functions also only 20. Okay, set is what,"
6054.72,6066.88,"set is unordered, now the unordered part comes, set is unordered and simply if it is not unordered"
6066.88,6072.16,"then how can you change it, simply if it is unordered then how can you change it, okay,"
6072.16,6076.16,"now we will understand how set works, with understand how set works,"
6077.12,6088.5599999999995,"set is unordered collection of data, if I write here, simply in set whatever values you give,"
6088.5599999999995,6095.5199999999995,"in set, in set whatever values you give, it will change every signal time,"
6095.5199999999995,6102.88,"specify it, okay, it will change every single time you specify it, like you are writing in a"
6103.12,6110.4800000000005,"particular order, the next time the order gets changes, if you are getting my point, if I write here,"
6111.12,6129.12,"e is equal to, just say 1, 2, 1, all is just say 50, 60, 100, okay, if I write here, e, if I run this,"
6130.08,6138.88,"see, focus here, right, focus here, if I am running this, I have stored the values as 1, 2,"
6138.96,6143.84,"50, 60, 100, okay, if I run this, see,"
6154.400000000001,6158.72,"I think it is not working, that is not working, we change it again,"
6158.72,6167.12,"I think it is not working, give me minute, let me fix it,"
6167.12,6189.68,"I think this is not working, give me minute, it should work,"
6197.2,6204.48,"yeah, that is for tuple, I know that is for tuple, okay, okay, okay, it is working, okay,"
6204.48,6208.16,"okay, okay, it is working fine, okay, it is working fine, okay, it is working fine, now,"
6209.2,6216.32,"order and one thing more, one important thing, one important thing, set is set always"
6216.32,6225.2,"stores unique value, I forgot to tell this, okay, okay, R she is in, okay, okay, because it is"
6225.2,6235.759999999999,"an order right, what I told you, set always stores unique value, R she is, I told you right, set"
6235.759999999999,6242.48,"always stores unique values, and here, true can be treated as 1, when I was telling you about"
6242.48,6250.4,"operators, I told you that in Python, true is treated like 1, and false treated like 0, okay,"
6250.4,6259.759999999999,"either of them Python, this set will store, either true or 1, getting it, if I write here false,"
6259.759999999999,6270.08,"also, if I write here false also, another write here 0 also, getting to see this, either false or 0,"
6270.08,6276.48,"it can take any one of them, but it will always store unique values, okay, R she is, the main"
6276.48,6282.48,"thing is that set always stores unique values, like, okay, understand set by a small,"
6282.48,6291.76,"a life example, like in a class, in a class there can be multiple, multiple people with the name R she is,"
6291.76,6298.24,"but their role numbers are distinct, right, so the set is like the role number, which are distinct,"
6298.24,6305.12,"you cannot have duplicate values in set, it only stores unique elements, it only stores unique"
6305.12,6310.48,"elements, whatever you give, it will always be stored in a unique way, all the elements must be"
6310.48,6317.76,"unique, this is the main property of set, set is unordered collection of data, but it always stores"
6317.76,6325.2,"unique values, that is my point, set will never store duplicate values, it always stores unique values,"
6325.5199999999995,6332.24,"now, this is a simple functionalities of set, instead you cannot perform multiple function because"
6332.24,6340.96,"it is unordered also, and so can you do 0 instead of, okay, where, okay, okay, so can you do 0 false,"
6341.679999999999,6349.599999999999,"once, 0, okay, okay, understand, Madharmakila set operates on something that is called as has"
6350.400000000001,6357.360000000001,"function, it is not known to us, it can print 0 all sometimes, it can also print false all sometimes,"
6357.360000000001,6363.6,"it is up to the set and hash function, which value it wants to take, it is totally up to it,"
6363.6,6370.240000000001,"we cannot specify that it should give false or it should give 0, it is up to the hash function,"
6370.240000000001,6377.360000000001,"that is a work inside the set, that gives the output, it is not up to us that if we want 0, so it"
6377.36,6383.92,"will should give 0 and not false, it is up to hash function, that is working beside the set,"
6383.92,6391.12,"that gives the output, okay, see, now we are getting a different output, now we are getting a different"
6391.12,6394.799999999999,"output, now we are getting 0 and 1, we are not getting false entry, we are getting 0 and 1,"
6395.679999999999,6400.88,"so it is acting differently, the order is not fixed, and there is something called as hash function,"
6400.88,6406.88,"that is working behind the set, and has function give different output according to its understand,"
6406.88,6412.400000000001,"it is not to up to us, which order or which value we will get, but it is up to the,"
6413.4400000000005,6418.4800000000005,"Madanmakhla, it is not fixed, Madanmakhla, by default it is, but it is not fixed, every time you"
6418.4800000000005,6424.24,"will not get it, Madanmakhla, you might get it once twice or thrice or maybe four or five times,"
6424.24,6434.24,"but every time it will not get, okay, every time it is not fixed, okay, Madanmakhla, I hope it is"
6434.24,6441.679999999999,"clear, okay, okay, okay, Ashish is giving me, okay, yesterday's code, right, okay, Ashish,"
6442.32,6448.0,"right number of composite, okay, Ashish, I will quickly come to it, I will quickly take 10 minutes more"
6448.0,6454.32,"to teach you dictionary and functions, then I will move back to the yesterday's code, okay,"
6454.32,6459.04,"number is prime or composite, it is equal to your print hole number, okay, good try Ashish,"
6459.04,6464.32,"good try, okay, I will quickly take 10 minutes more and we will then move on to the yesterday's"
6464.32,6470.48,"question, only 10 more minutes, okay, this was sex and then we have something called as dictionary also,"
6472.32,6480.0,"okay, dictionary is exactly like a real life dictionary, exactly dictionary in python is like a"
6480.0,6487.6,"real life dictionary, we all have used real life dictionary in a dictionary, the value is always"
6487.6,6494.88,"stored in, this is the most important thing, always stored in key value pairs, the values are"
6494.88,6499.92,"always stored in key value pairs, what do I mean when I say key value pairs, understand,"
6500.8,6506.56,"again, by use of, okay, Nareesh, Nareesh, the most important use of set is used to store unique"
6506.56,6512.96,"values, the use of set is used to, that it is used to store unique value, that is the most"
6512.96,6519.68,"important functionality of set, that it will always store unique values, it do not allows for duplicates,"
6520.4800000000005,6526.4800000000005,"okay, I hope it works, Nareesh, this is a simple use of set, now coming to dictionary,"
6527.68,6533.2,"see, in a real life dictionary what happens, okay, understand, understand, I will take a small example"
6533.2,6539.92,"and then you will be able to understand, see, let us suppose you want to search the meaning of a world,"
6540.4,6546.56,"you want to search the meaning of a world, okay, so let us just say any word, we just say the word is"
6548.16,6555.92,"any complex word, honor, honor, the word is honor, now you want to search the meaning of word honor,"
6555.92,6561.28,"so what you will do is, you will open the dictionary, then you will search for the word honor in"
6561.28,6568.56,"the dictionary, when you go to the search honor, yeah, it will like, yeah, when you go to the honor,"
6568.64,6575.76,"you will get a particular meaning for honor, right, so in the same bit dictionary also works in"
6575.76,6585.360000000001,"Python, there is a key, that is like the name, the exact name of the word and there is a value,"
6585.360000000001,6591.120000000001,"that is like the meaning of the word, it exactly function like objects like Nareesh saying,"
6591.120000000001,6597.04,"like there is a one object, that objects store some value, then there is another object,"
6597.04,6602.0,"and the other object also store some value, okay, Nareesh, it is similar to that, dictionary"
6602.56,6610.8,"function like that only, no one important thing, one very important thing, that key is, key is"
6610.8,6622.72,"always unique, key is always unique, duplicate keys are not allowed, duplicate keys are not allowed,"
6623.68,6630.8,"but if you duplicate keys, Python will not give an error, rather giving an error, it will take the"
6630.8,6638.400000000001,"last given key, okay, it will take the last given key, now values, what about values, values can be"
6638.400000000001,6644.16,"duplicate, okay, understand this very important thing, okay, guys, I hope you are getting it,"
6644.72,6649.6,"I hope you are getting it what dictionary is, dictionary is like a real life dictionary, where"
6649.84,6657.92,"the elements are stored in key value pairs, keys like the name of the word and the values like the"
6657.92,6661.84,"meaning of the word, okay, when you want to fetch the meaning, first you have to go to the"
6661.84,6666.400000000001,"particular key or particular word, only then you will get the meaning of that particular word,"
6666.400000000001,6672.240000000001,"okay, then the very important thing is that the key or the name of the word should always be unique,"
6672.240000000001,6678.72,"it can never be duplicate, but the values that key store, it can be duplicate, now one more"
6678.72,6686.240000000001,"question you guys can ask me is that if we give 2 or 3 keys, let us say you have given 3 keys,"
6686.240000000001,6694.08,"and the name of the 3 keys are all honor, okay, all the 3 keys name is honor, but all the 3 keys"
6694.08,6700.400000000001,"whole different values, 3 keys are having different values, but the names are same, that is honor,"
6700.400000000001,6707.76,"honor and honor, then will it give an error, will it give an error, even if the keys name is same,"
6707.76,6711.76,"no, it will not give an error, it will take the last given key, correct,"
6711.76,6717.360000000001,"now you are, of the way you exactly correct, it will take the last given key, okay,"
6718.08,6723.04,"this is what happens in dictionary, quickly let me declare dictionary, you will understand"
6723.04,6732.64,"how it is storing key value pairs, I will give an example of cricket, let us just take example of"
6733.12,6740.8,"cricket, now this is the how we declare dictionary, see, I will write let us just say such and,"
6741.6,6746.320000000001,"such and is a key, I will make such and as key, inside such and I will store the element,"
6746.320000000001,6754.0,"let us say here he has got a century, and again you can go for anyone, ganguly or"
6754.24,6762.96,"and he has stored the element, let us just say 80 runs, also a comma here,"
6765.92,6777.04,"again comma, near the name, draw it, right, for the will also store let us just say 86,"
6777.84,6782.08,"and the elements I am storing, one more let us just take, let us just say Gambir,"
6784.72,6793.04,"and here is scored 94, okay, you want Virat also, okay, I will just do Virat 2,"
6795.12,6801.84,"and let us just say Virat has also scored a century, century, okay,"
6802.56,6810.0,"okay, 200, no issues, no issues, okay, 200, let us give 250, okay, I will give 250, not"
6810.0,6818.0,"for, I will give 250, okay, okay, what, so what is happening, what is happening, okay, test"
6818.0,6822.32,"maths, okay, it is like a test maths, okay, no issues, I just like a test maths, so Virat has"
6822.32,6830.400000000001,"scored a century, okay, no issues, so what is happening here is, okay, I missed MSD, I missed MSD,"
6830.4,6835.36,"okay, I missed MSD, okay, okay, I can never miss Dhoni,"
6838.24,6844.48,"like this is Dhoni, I scored 120 runs, okay, now, now quickly move, get back to a topic, okay,"
6845.44,6849.44,"okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, guys, you are making it complex for me,"
6850.08,6854.4,"I will wait, how, again, see there are a lot of famous players, that is why I do not want to take"
6854.48,6861.839999999999,"real life examples like this, like this, say Rohit has scored 150, okay, okay, guys, now, understand,"
6862.4,6867.92,"what is happening is, these are the key, these are keys and these are the values, okay,"
6867.92,6872.16,"Ravinder, are you asking something, Ravinder, are you asking, okay, Rohit, okay, I have taken"
6872.16,6878.0,"Rohit also, okay, and where Ravinder, I took Rohit also, okay, I have bit workspins, okay,"
6878.08,6882.96,"now, quickly understand that, what the actual functionalities we implement it is,"
6883.68,6889.84,"we have these keys, these are the keys and these are the values, these keys are holding,"
6889.84,6896.16,"get in my point, such in is the key and 100 is the value that such in is holding,"
6896.16,6901.92,"then we have Ganguly Ganguly is again a different key and his holding a value of 80,"
6901.92,6906.88,"this is how a dictionary function, if I write here, if I run this, simply write,"
6908.88,6918.96,"we will get a dictionary, we will get a dictionary, see, different, all are different, now,"
6919.52,6925.76,"one more thing, one more thing, what I told you is that regarding keys, keys are always unique,"
6925.76,6932.16,"what if I write here, what if I write, copy this entire thing,"
6932.72,6941.44,"when do we see, or in this only I will change something, in this only I will change something,"
6941.44,6948.24,"I will again write, just say, Dravid, okay, and I will write here,"
6950.0,6962.0,"let's just say 90, okay, now, see, Dravid is only taking 90, it is not taking"
6962.0,6968.32,"86, now the value of Dravid is the last given input that is 90, I told you, right,"
6968.32,6974.32,"for key, the last if there are multiple keys with the same name that is duplicate key,"
6974.32,6982.56,"then the last given key will be taken, okay, okay, now Ashis is asking sir, we are specifying key in"
6984.16,6988.24,"because it is string, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, correct, correct, correct, correct, correct, correct,"
6988.24,6990.72,"correct, yeah, Ashis, you are exactly correct,"
6992.56,7002.88,"okay, now, now, I hope you are getting how keys can never be duplicates,"
7007.2,7011.76,"but yeah, you can give, you can give, you can give, it is up to you, how you want to specify,"
7011.76,7016.08,"it is up to you, how you want to specify, and what particular type of values you want,"
7016.08,7021.92,"okay, it is up to you, it is up to you, right, it is up to us, I want it, it is I string format,"
7021.92,7027.2,"that is why I took the names, I wanted the names of the player, right, and we give name by string,"
7027.2,7035.6,"right, by default string is nothing but a, but a combination of characters, now, now, understand,"
7035.6,7039.5199999999995,"now, understand how you access the elements, quickly just understand in a minute,"
7040.240000000001,7046.72,"how you access the elements of the key, okay, simply a right print,"
7048.8,7061.84,"and I will write layer, and simply write here, the name of come the, or be r, okay,"
7062.08,7071.76,"I simply run this, and I get the values, this is the key, this is the key, and this is the value"
7071.76,7077.76,"that we get, okay, this is the key, Virat is the key, and the values to 50, that Virat had"
7077.76,7084.32,"scored to 50 runs, okay, this is a value that this particular key is holding, you can access any key"
7084.32,7091.52,"like that, okay, also, also, if you want to update an element, you can update, you can directly assign"
7091.52,7096.400000000001,"equal to like the list in, in the list you are changing, in the same way you can update,"
7097.4400000000005,7103.84,"as she's similar to a list, similar, no, no, yeah, similar, but similar, but the main differences,"
7103.84,7108.96,"in list you can have duplicate element, but in keys, you cannot have duplicate, list can be"
7108.96,7113.76,"duplicates, in list you can have duplicate element, but inside a key, you cannot have duplicate"
7113.76,7118.080000000001,"elements, okay, I have, this is clear to you, now, quickly move on to functions, function is"
7118.08,7124.72,"very important, right, function, it will hardly take 10 minutes, but it's very important, functions,"
7126.16,7132.96,"okay, understand what function basically is, okay, function is like an inbuilt method, function"
7132.96,7138.8,"is like an inbuilt method, okay, you want to repeat certain tasks, okay, function is basically"
7138.8,7144.16,"used when, when you want to repeat certain tasks in your code, for that thing, you will not"
7144.24,7150.4,"write the code multiple times, you can simply write one code and call it multiple times, okay,"
7151.2,7157.44,"okay, simply write one code and call it multiple times, and that is how exactly, function is working,"
7157.44,7162.96,"okay, I just quickly define a code, okay, now, let us say you have number one that is 50,"
7164.08,7170.96,"and you have number two that is 60, and you want to add those code numbers, and you want to,"
7171.04,7178.08,"so what, normally what we do is, we can simply do like this also, print number one plus number two,"
7178.08,7182.32,"or you can create a new variable installed the values, or you can do like this also,"
7183.52,7188.0,"this is a normal way that we do, right, so this is a normal way that we do, but"
7189.84,7196.08,"what we can do is create a function also, we can create dev, dev is the keyword that we use for"
7196.16,7201.6,"declaring a function, dev, okay guys, understand that, dev is the keyword that we use for declaring a"
7201.6,7206.8,"function, we will write dev, we will give some function name, we will write add, the function name is"
7206.8,7213.2,"add, this is the function name, then we will write the parameter, the first parameter is number one,"
7213.2,7217.6,"the second parameter is number two, you can give and parameters of the choice, it is up to you,"
7217.68,7229.76,"how much parameter do you want to give, now what I will do is, print number one plus number two,"
7230.96,7233.92,"or you can write return number one plus number, it is up to you,"
7235.6,7243.360000000001,"why go down, and here I will write add, I will call this function, this is how we call this function,"
7243.36,7248.32,"I will write add, then I want to add what values, let us just say I want to add four and five,"
7249.44,7257.12,"then I run this, the output is nine, how is working, again I will tell you why, I will repeat again,"
7257.12,7265.04,"see, function is nothing, but it is like a to do repeated task, let us say you want to add"
7265.759999999999,7270.48,"numbers in your code, so for that you have to repeat that task multiple number of time, you have"
7270.639999999999,7276.48,"to write that code multiple number of times, rather than doing that what you can do is, you can do is"
7276.48,7282.0,"simply create a function, and just call their function multiple times, simply create a function,"
7282.0,7288.0,"a block of code, and every time you want the same functionalities, you can simply call that block"
7288.0,7294.24,"of code as simple as that, so function is very very important, you should create 10, create 5, 10"
7294.719999999999,7300.719999999999,"function by yourself, and you will be getting the point, I have simply created an addition function,"
7300.719999999999,7305.599999999999,"which adds, which takes two parameters, you can take five parameters also, it is up to you,"
7305.599999999999,7311.84,"how much parameters you want, then you can simply what I did, I printed an output, that is add those"
7311.84,7317.36,"numbers inside the functions, and then I called the function by the function name, the function name"
7317.36,7323.5199999999995,"was what, the function name was add, I called the function name, and simply I given the values that I"
7323.6,7331.4400000000005,"wanted to execute that were 4 and 5, and I got the output as 9, I will write one more code,"
7333.200000000001,7338.320000000001,"you can do this also, I will write one more code, quickly I will write one more code, and you"
7338.320000000001,7347.200000000001,"will be able to get the concept, in the place of this, you can write this all,"
7353.6,7364.4800000000005,"both works fine, both works fine, but return is a better method, return is with return method,"
7364.4800000000005,7370.72,"whatever values are getting, you can use it later also, with return method whatever values"
7370.72,7375.6,"are you are getting, you can use later also, but using print, it will directly print on the"
7375.6,7382.400000000001,"console, and you will not be able to use the values that are on, this is the basic difference between"
7382.48,7388.639999999999,"print and return, now one more thing, one more code quickly, and you will be able to get what"
7388.639999999999,7397.12,"function basically is, I will simply write greed, okay, this is a new function I am creating,"
7397.12,7400.96,"and the name of function is greed, this is a default syntax for creating a function dev,"
7401.839999999999,7407.44,"the function name is greed, inside this I am getting a parameter name, I have only given one parameter,"
7407.44,7411.36,"this time I only wanted to give one parameter, you can give any parameter of your child,"
7412.0,7418.0,"I will write print, I will simply write my name is,"
7424.88,7430.32,"hello, my name is, and here you can give anything,"
7431.599999999999,7437.5199999999995,"for a mass, base, name, okay, this is a function that I have created, small function that I have"
7437.6,7443.200000000001,"I will simply write here greed, every time I want to run this function, I will simply write greed,"
7443.200000000001,7452.72,"you can give any name, let us give un-over-a-z, okay, un-over, again I will call the same function,"
7452.72,7456.96,"I will not, I am not writing the same thing multiple time, I am simply calling the function,"
7456.96,7463.92,"I can give cool deep name here, okay, again I can go down, again I will call the function,"
7463.92,7468.72,"again I will, I am just calling, see you can see that I am not writing hello, my name is,"
7468.72,7475.04,"I am simply calling the function multiple time, and it is there, again you can give any name,"
7475.04,7481.4400000000005,"it is up to you what you want, as she says there, okay, I am simply calling my function,"
7481.4400000000005,7487.12,"every time I run it, I simply get my function, okay, this is how my code works,"
7487.28,7497.04,"okay, you can see hello, my name is, un-over, you are getting different, you are not writing hello,"
7497.04,7502.24,"my name is, un-over, hello, my name is, is hello, my name is, simply you are calling the function,"
7502.24,7506.5599999999995,"simply calling the function by function name, and you are getting the output, okay,"
7507.12,7513.04,"at my point how, what function basically is, guys, getting my point by function basically is,"
7513.2,7520.0,"to repeat certain tasks in a code, you simply write one code and simply call it multiple times,"
7520.0,7525.5199999999995,"okay, this is what function is, this is how function basically works, and this is how function"
7525.5199999999995,7532.32,"basically is, to repeat certain tasks in our code, to do the same task if you want to do multiple"
7532.32,7537.44,"time, you will create, do it one time and simply call it multiple number time, other people,"
7537.839999999999,7543.679999999999,"the people, I hope you are able to get it, what function basically is, other people,"
7544.639999999999,7551.04,"okay, okay, okay, nice, nice, now quickly guys, quickly I give you, I give you a few questions to do,"
7551.04,7556.32,"yesterday, now give me quickly the code for that, okay, nourish, okay, nourish, nourish,"
7556.32,7559.36,"I will have a phone while look, nourish, okay, I will have a phone while look, okay, nourish,"
7560.08,7565.599999999999,"while look is nothing, while look is nothing, but it is used for, it is used when,"
7566.160000000001,7572.4800000000005,"first you should know it is used when, while look is basically used when we do not know the number"
7572.4800000000005,7578.160000000001,"of iteration to be performed, while look is used when we do not know the number of iteration to"
7578.160000000001,7584.240000000001,"be performed, and this is the basic difference for look and while look inside for look, you know the"
7584.240000000001,7589.84,"number of iterations because they are fixed, but in a while look you can have infinite values also,"
7590.8,7596.4800000000005,"okay, nourish, understand that with a while look, you can have infinite values also, but"
7597.04,7603.04,"with all you, you cannot accomplish the same, this is the basic difference to involve while look"
7603.04,7608.0,"and follow, understand that you can implement the same functionalities using while look also"
7608.0,7614.08,"and follow also, most of the functionalities, you can have in both of the same are same, but the"
7614.08,7619.12,"mean difference between while look and follow is that, in follow the number of iterations is"
7619.2,7625.04,"already known to you, it is already fixed, but in while look you do not know the exact number"
7625.04,7630.48,"of iteration, you need to perform, and this is the basic difference in while look and follow,"
7630.48,7634.48,"guys, now quickly give me the course for the course that I gave you yesterday quickly,"
7635.76,7640.48,"okay, Vignesh has seen me the first code, check if a number is given up because I will take your"
7640.48,7645.04,"course only, I will take because I do not have cat must time right, quickly take your course,"
7645.04,7649.12,"Vignesh your code is exactly correct, I am not, let me check your code, okay,"
7649.12,7654.56,"input into the number, okay, I am not not, for the first question your code is exactly correct,"
7654.56,7658.88,"this was the homework question right, this was a practice question,"
7660.64,7665.04,"I give you yesterday, okay, it is absolutely correct,"
7669.6,7673.84,"it is 24 I am entering, okay, even, correct,"
7675.68,7681.28,"you can take different ways to do it, now, Aman has been a bit differently, I take Aman's code to,"
7682.0,7689.44,"I see, now, who was that, Vignesh, right, Vignesh has used the formatted string, Vignesh has used"
7689.44,7694.72,"the formatted string and Aman has done directly, both are, okay, both are correct, again if I write"
7694.72,7699.92,"here 24, I will get the out of that, it is done, even number, both are correct, both are"
7699.92,7707.36,"are totally correct, now, I will go down, I will move to the next question, Vignesh has sent"
7707.36,7714.4800000000005,"to check if a number is, okay, Vignesh, I will take your code again, okay, give me a minute, give me a minute,"
7720.32,7725.68,"you have to check if a number is prime or, no, no, okay, this is even or not, okay,"
7726.240000000001,7732.96,"not this one, not this one, not this one, I took this one, I want to see if I check if a number is"
7732.96,7743.4400000000005,"prime or composite, yeah, now it is okay, I run this and if I check for 9, 9 is prime or composite,"
7743.4400000000005,7749.12,"9 is composite, right, 9 should, okay, not a prime number then it can be called a composite number,"
7749.76,7755.28,"okay, and where, check if a number is even or not, okay, and, okay, and where your code is also"
7755.28,7762.08,"correct, and where your code is correct, correct, Vignesh, now you have also, okay, Vignesh,"
7762.08,7769.2,"good, good attempt Vignesh, you have done all the three questions, good try,"
7769.28,7778.72,"other people, I hope you guys practice it too, the people, I hope you guys have practiced the"
7778.72,7783.679999999999,"questions, I will explain, I will explain, I am an I will explain, guess give me a minute, I will"
7783.679999999999,7788.08,"explain, that is why I quickly completed the task and move on to this, give me a minute,"
7788.08,7800.24,"okay, try to done this first, you try to form addition operation, and the first number, I want"
7800.24,7811.6,"to endeavor to 50, second number is like 20, and the operator I want to plus, correct, good,"
7811.6,7817.6,"Vignesh, good try, nice, you are able to understand the concept like, now I am asking"
7819.04,7823.28,"okay, this is next, yeah good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, nice,"
7824.5599999999995,7830.96,"endeavor, primer composite, okay, ever good attempt, ashish, ashish, ashish, ashish, you too,"
7830.96,7835.04,"ashish, you too, good attempt, correct, correct, correct, correct, you have put it right,"
7835.04,7841.04,"now, I am asking you to explain what prime, prime, prime, I will explain all the three"
7841.12,7845.36,"course, I will quickly explain all the three course, because we have five or minutes, I will just"
7845.36,7857.84,"explain all the three course, it was to check if number is even or not, I think it was the first"
7857.84,7863.68,"question, okay, people were not able to do it, these was the three questions that I gave it to you,"
7863.68,7869.12,"understand, I will explain all the three questions, okay, see, okay, ashish, go try,"
7869.12,7875.36,"remember you to your course are correct, see, very first question was to check if a number is,"
7875.36,7882.16,"to check if a number is prime or composite, okay, so what we did was, if it is simply check,"
7882.16,7887.5199999999995,"if a number is divisible by two, then it is prime and if it and if the number is not divisible by two,"
7887.5199999999995,7894.88,"then it is not prime, simply, so what we did was we checked the, we checked with the modulus"
7895.36,7899.84,"operator and we got the output as 0, and if we got the output as 0, then the number is even,"
7899.84,7904.72,"if not then it is not as simple as that, this was a very simple question, very simple application,"
7905.28,7911.68,"then this is, he did was using formatted string and this he used directly, both are"
7911.68,7916.400000000001,"applicable, you can use either of the methods, it is up to you which method you want to check,"
7916.400000000001,7920.96,"now the important questions, to check if a number is prime or composite,"
7921.44,7930.64,"now, here what it was, first he took the dynamic input from the user, good, good that he did not"
7930.64,7937.44,"take the input himself, he is asking the user to give the input, now he will check, now the starting"
7937.44,7942.4800000000005,"of a prime number is two, the smallest prime number is two, so if a number is less than one, not a prime"
7942.5599999999995,7952.639999999999,"number, good, good, this the first condition is correct, now else he, he entered inside the"
7953.28,7960.0,"L statement, inside the L statement, he had initiated I is equal to two, now he will again check"
7960.719999999999,7968.5599999999995,"until and unless I is then less than number, until and unless I is then less than number,"
7968.64,7976.080000000001,"I want this particular block to be executed, this is the condition, until the I is less than number,"
7976.72,7983.76,"number is what the user is inputting, my this particular block should run, what is this particular"
7983.76,7994.240000000001,"block, if number modulus I is equal to 0, that means that particular number has one more factor,"
7994.32,8000.0,"if it has more than two factors, then it is a composite number, you can write here composite"
8000.0,8006.08,"number also, that means, if it is not composite, then it is not a prime number, okay, now,"
8006.719999999999,8011.28,"that means, after this he simply came out of the loop and use the break statement and"
8012.08,8018.32,"every single time it is itery, it is incrementing by one, every time the value is getting"
8018.4,8024.24,"incremented by one, this is I is equal to I plus 1, else print prime number, if it has not more"
8024.24,8031.5199999999995,"than two factors, then by default it is a prime number, okay, let us check for, logistic for three,"
8033.92,8039.5199999999995,"prime number, correct, your code is working exactly, okay, this was exact functionality,"
8039.5199999999995,8044.24,"now create a calculator code, simply if printed statement,"
8044.5599999999995,8050.4,"calculator, then it took two input from the user, now he is asking from the user, what operation"
8050.4,8056.96,"he needs to perform, addition, subtraction, multiplication or division, you can choose between either"
8056.96,8064.719999999999,"of them, now if the if the user enters plus, then he will perform addition, else if the user"
8064.719999999999,8072.96,"enters minus, then he will perform subtraction and so on and so on, okay, good, good, and also,"
8072.96,8081.12,"also given one more condition that if the he enters 0, then it will given either also, good,"
8081.12,8088.88,"good, good, you have extra condition also, else the if you give any other operator other than these"
8088.88,8093.68,"four, then it is not getting considered that is invalid, okay, by default this will then,"
8093.68,8097.52,"I hope these questions are clear, you can go through guys for not getting this, you can go through"
8097.52,8102.88,"this code once, that is why I printed it inside my profile, you can go through these and you"
8102.88,8109.36,"will get a simple idea how to get it, okay, yeah, yeah, we need a good job, we need a good"
8109.36,8113.92,"job, we need a code is a totally correct, we need a good job, the people can only go through"
8113.92,8117.68,"these codes once and you will able to get the concepts, you will able to get the concept correct,"
8117.68,8123.92,"okay, nothing tough in this, okay guys, I hope you guys were able to understand two other concepts,"
8124.8,8130.16,"list, upper set, dictionary and functions, other people I hope you guys were able to understand,"
8133.52,8138.88,"any questions, should I share this file to you, okay, other people could leave, God the"
8138.88,8145.28,"concept, other people, I want to other people, okay, mother, maquilla, list, up, guys kindly practice,"
8145.28,8150.400000000001,"guys kindly practice list, up, set, dictionary and functions well, okay, practice well, okay,"
8151.28,8156.08,"okay, I only got four responses, unword, betwise, unword, okay, unword, betwise, I will just"
8156.08,8163.2,"simply tell it to betwise operators, we inside betwise, we simply do operation between 1 and 0,"
8163.2,8168.5599999999995,"simply, it is similar to logical operator, but let us say you have the number as four,"
8168.5599999999995,8173.76,"then what you do is you convert to decimal values, but in terms of 1 and 0, then you perform the"
8173.76,8181.04,"logic, then you perform the AND or not operator, okay, okay, Ashish, it is already 8.7, Ashish,"
8181.04,8186.96,"you can see this nested loop, it is nested only, you can use, okay, Ashish, you can write the code,"
8186.96,8194.48,"right, just write nested loop, I think someone wrote a code, okay, yeah, yeah, okay, okay, here, here,"
8195.68,8203.68,"this is nested loop, okay, Ashish, okay, okay, Ashish, Ashish, this is nested loop, see,"
8204.08,8211.36,"this is the first for loop, inside the first for loop, we have again indicated and the"
8211.36,8222.880000000001,"for loop, this is nested loop, Ashish, this, okay, let us run this, see, you can simply get a stop at"
8222.880000000001,8226.800000000001,"an a very famous question, this is a very, very famous question, you can simply get a stop at an"
8226.88,8235.279999999999,"also, okay, this is, see, inside the first loop, there is another loop you are defining, when"
8235.759999999998,8240.32,"you enter the first loop, there is another loop, and inside it, you are putting me something, okay,"
8240.32,8244.72,"this is how let us follow for, you can have, you can have nested while loop also, it is up to you,"
8244.72,8248.8,"how you want to get to function, inside for you can have while, inside while you can have,"
8248.8,8255.199999999999,"it is up to you, how you want to do, okay, I hope it is clear, quickly go, just go through it once,"
8255.2,8262.640000000001,"and you will understand the concept, for a bit wise, unvert the main concept is that,"
8262.640000000001,8269.2,"for bit wise, unvert the main concept is that, it will, let this say you have 5 and 6, you want"
8269.2,8274.240000000002,"to perform this operation, then what you will do, you will convert 5, the number 5 to decimal"
8274.240000000002,8280.800000000001,"values to bits between 1 and 0, and then you will perform that operation, let us say again,"
8280.88,8286.88,"if you get 1, 0, 1, you have 5, that means, 101, then again you have 6, it,"
8288.24,8292.0,"it will be converted into bits, then you will perform the operation, directly,"
8292.0,8297.119999999999,"multiply here, when you perform addition, that means, that means, multiplication, that is like"
8297.119999999999,8302.96,"1 into 1, it will give 1, then again you will get some bit values, again you will convert bit wise"
8302.96,8308.72,"to decimal or the real form, let us say you, you will convert the real number like 2 and 3 and 4,"
8308.88,8313.679999999998,"this is how it works, there is nothing to unvert, kind of go through it once, I hope you will be"
8313.679999999998,8318.96,"able to clear it, if guys, if there is something that is not clear to you, you can raise a ticket,"
8318.96,8325.519999999999,"that I need a 1 on 1 session, especially for that, and will be clearing out, from my side,"
8326.8,8332.08,"Python basic is nearly complete, if you guys are having any issues at any kind,"
8332.56,8337.679999999998,"in any concept of Python basic, you can raise a ticket for 1 on 1 session, and will be taking from"
8337.68,8344.64,"there, I hope it is clear guys, I am ending my screen share, and I will share the"
8344.64,8350.64,"class file with you quickly, skip me a minute, I will end my screen share, and I will share this file"
8351.359999999999,8351.92,"skip me a minute,"
8365.92,8373.359999999999,"okay, shiram, practice question, okay, okay, shiram, I want you to implement nested loops,"
8374.48,8380.08,"nested loops, okay, print test, okay, I will write in the code pattern, in the code,"
8380.8,8387.68,"print a star pattern, okay, shall I write in the file only, okay, I will write in the file only,"
8387.68,8409.039999999999,"okay, my question to is, is, print a star pattern, print a star pattern, in both ascending and"
8410.64,8423.119999999999,"descending order, okay, I have already implemented ascending, you can, you need to implement"
8423.119999999999,8428.32,"in descending order also, for the people who are learning it for the first time, you should do it"
8428.32,8433.84,"for both, okay, ascending and descending both, wait, I will just share the class file with you quickly,"
8434.8,8441.92,"a minute, yeah, I have shared the class file and I have shared the question also,"
8441.92,8448.08,"and one thing more, rah shiram, I have not implemented all the functions for list up,"
8448.08,8456.0,"so what you need to do is implement the functions for tuples also, okay, this is a basic practice"
8456.0,8461.36,"practice that you need to do, implement list, implement tuples like list only then see how"
8461.52,8467.44,"set is working then understand how dictionary is working, write few course regarding functions,"
8467.44,8472.32,"you can create a calculator use function, okay, you can create a calculator using function also,"
8472.32,8477.84,"you know that, I write in the chart section this, calculator using functions, you can create this"
8477.84,8483.76,"a very good question, you can create calculator using function, I have written the chart section,"
8484.56,8494.48,"create a calculator using functions, okay, guys, this is it from my side, this was your batch that"
8494.48,8500.32,"was allotted to me regarding Python basics, and I hope that I was able to teach you something and"
8500.32,8504.72,"you were able to learn something from me, okay, I don't know if you will meeting back again,"
8504.72,8510.48,"if I will get your batch again, I will take it, but if I will not, no issues, you can connect"
8510.56,8514.24,"with me in one of my sessions, if you want a particular one of my sessions with me, you can"
8514.24,8520.8,"raise a ticket from for my name, I will take it from there, or if some other trainable be taking it,"
8520.8,8526.96,"you will be understanding the concept, no issues, okay, I hope it is everything is clear to you guys,"
8526.96,8535.199999999999,"okay, okay guys, I hope you learn something, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, cool,"
8535.28,8541.6,"that is the main thing, see, concepts is in your mind, but the most important thing is practice,"
8541.6,8547.52,"because see that code is not wrong, that practice makes a man perfect, man or woman perfect,"
8547.52,8552.240000000002,"you can take anything, both are okay, see with practice only you will be getting the concept,"
8552.240000000002,8557.28,"even if you have the concept in your mind, without concept they will fade away, okay, so get practice"
8558.0,8564.08,"to some number of questions, guys, understand you have so many AI tools, just write in the chat,"
8564.08,8571.28,"the pt or any AI tool that give me questions on list, give me basic to advanced question on list"
8571.28,8577.2,"sets, the dictionary, then function, give me basic to advanced question on functions,"
8577.2,8583.36,"and then it will give you to not see the codes, see the questions, and on the basis of their"
8583.36,8587.76,"question frame, just think for one or two minutes, this is called critical thinking, think for one or"
8587.76,8593.2,"two minutes, then see the approach that you are going to follow, and follow that particular approach,"
8594.08,8598.480000000001,"and you will be, I am sure that you will excel the question, you will be able to do that question"
8598.480000000001,8605.2,"in the limited time only, okay, well, all you need is practice, do more practice, and if you guys"
8605.2,8609.52,"are having any confusion in that practice, and connect with us in the one-on-one session, I will"
8609.52,8615.04,"solve your doubts, I will show all the best in this learning, other people, I hope you guys were"
8615.04,8625.28,"able to learn something, okay, okay guys, thank you so much, other people, Jalpa, Vignesh,"
8625.28,8629.84,"I hope you will be meeting again, I hope you will be meeting again, if not, you can connect with"
8629.84,8634.880000000001,"me in one-on-one session, thank you so much guys, thank you so much, thank you everyone, thank you,"
8634.880000000001,8639.2,"thank you everyone, we had a great learning session, right, it was very interactive, and I loved"
8639.28,8644.880000000001,"interacting with you guys, okay, thank you so much, you can leave the meeting guys, you can leave the"
8644.880000000001,8649.68,"meeting now, I will share the Kaleha file once again, if you are not accessed, other people you can"
8649.68,8652.880000000001,"leave the meeting now, I am sharing the Kaleha file once again, thank you so much everyone,"
8654.08,8660.960000000001,"it was very nice, I had a wonderful session with you guys, okay, learned a lot of things,"
8661.76,8667.68,"again with you guys, it is all a part of learning for us, for you, for everyone, okay,"
8667.76,8672.720000000001,"a wish of great learning journey, journey, sorry, okay, thank you so much, thank you so much guys,"
8672.720000000001,8683.12,"okay, you can leave the meeting, I am ending the meeting from my side, okay, thank you so much,"
8685.2,8689.36,"okay, I am ending the meeting, I am ending the meeting guys, okay, thank you so much,"
