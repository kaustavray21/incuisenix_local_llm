"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome all to this Python certification course."
"8.32"," In our previous session we learned about data visualization basics and we also saw what"
"12.92"," are the various data visualization library available in Python."
"16.44"," So in today's session we'll learn about introduction to Matplotlib and we'll cover topics"
"21.48"," like what is Matplotlib?"
"24.32"," Why choose Matplotlib for visualizing our data?"
"27.12"," And what are the different types of plot that can be created using Matplotlib?"
"31.28"," So without delaying any further, let's start with what is Matplotlib?"
"36.08"," Well Matplotlib is an open source Python library used for visualizing our data."
"41.36"," It creates 2D graph and plot them using some Python scripts."
"45.0"," And once the plot is created you can produce the output in a variety of hardcopy formats"
"50.040000000000006"," like PNG or GIF."
"51.84"," Now let's have a look at some of the key points or the reason why we should use Matplotlib"
"62.040000000000006"," for data visualization."
"63.52"," So our first point is it has Pyplot."
"66.0"," Well Matplotlib has a Pyplot module which helps in easy customization of plot."
"71.4"," Second reason is in Matplotlib with the help of some simple functions we can add various"
"75.68"," plot elements such as lines, images, text etc."
"80.4"," Third is it supports a very wide variety of graphs and plots like histogram, bar charts,"
"86.48"," line chart, power spectra, error charts and many more."
"89.84"," Another reason to use Matplotlib is that it can easily integrate with different Python"
"94.28"," libraries such as pandas, numby etc."
"97.52000000000001"," And finally Matplotlib has object-oriented API which is used for embedding plots into"
"102.56"," applications."
"103.96000000000001"," So I hope now you understand why we are choosing Matplotlib for visualizing our data."
"108.2"," So let's move ahead and see what are the different types of plot you can create using"
"112.12"," Matplotlib."
"113.8"," So let's see type of plot."
"115.24000000000001"," So we have line plot, bar plot, scatter plot, histogram."
"120.0"," We also have image plot, box plot, violent plot, stream plot, quiver plot, area plot and"
"126.56"," finally we have Pyplot and donut plot."
"129.88"," So these are the different types of plot you can create using Matplotlib."
"133.56"," So this was all for this session."
"135.16"," And our next session will see how to use Matplotlib to create these plots."
"142.16"," Okay?"
