"0.0"," So hello guys and welcome back to Python certification course."
"8.4"," In our previous session we learned about how to perform a merge join and concatenate"
"12.48"," two different data frames."
"14.0"," Right."
"15.0"," I hope those things are clear to you guys."
"16.84"," So our today's session will mainly focus on how to import and analyze your data set."
"22.44"," So in this session you learn about how to import a data set using pandas and how to analyze"
"27.400000000000002"," various attributes of the data."
"29.44"," So I hope the agenda is clear to you guys."
"31.6"," So without delaying any further, let's start and see how we can import a data set using"
"36.28"," pandas."
"38.28"," So for importing the data set, the very first thing that you'll be doing is importing"
"41.84"," the pandas library."
"42.84"," So I'm importing pandas as PD."
"44.96"," So next we are going to read the data set and store it in a data frame."
"48.8"," So I'm defining a data frame named Cards and inside this I'm passing the path of my"
"53.040000000000006"," CSV file which is empty cars 2.csv."
"56.12"," At this point you can specify the path to your CSV file."
"60.04"," And finally we are printing it."
"61.8"," Let's see the output."
"63.0"," So this is my entire data."
"64.75999999999999"," So let's move ahead and see what are the various analysis we are going to perform on it."
"68.64"," So first is type cards."
"70.56"," So this type card is used to check the type or check the data type of the card."
"75.03999999999999"," So it's a data frame."
"76.03999999999999"," Right."
"77.03999999999999"," So as a part of output we got pandas.co.frame."
"79.44"," Data frame."
"80.44"," Okay."
"81.44"," So the type of cards is it's a data frame."
"83.52"," Next is cars.head."
"85.28"," Well this is used to view only the first five records of your data frame which in our"
"90.12"," cases this next is if you want to view first 10 records from your data set you can pass"
"96.52000000000001"," the attribute over here as 10 and so as output you will get first 10 data set from the"
"101.80000000000001"," data frame."
"102.96000000000001"," Okay."
"103.96000000000001"," Next is what if you want to view last five records then you can use the parameter data"
"108.60000000000001"," frame."
"109.60000000000001"," Take which in our cases cars.tail."
"112.0"," Okay."
"113.0"," So we'll give you the last five record of your data frame."
"115.6"," Okay."
"116.6"," Similarly if you want last 10 records from your data set you can specify a value over here."
"121.28"," So data frame.tail inside this I passed 10."
"124.4"," So this is giving me last 10 records from a data set of cars."
"128.76"," Okay."
"130.0"," Next is cars.shapes."
"131.52"," Now if you want to view the total number of rows and columns in your data frame for"
"135.2"," that you have data frame.shapes."
"137.92000000000002"," So cars.shapes gave me the output as 32 and 13 which means are 32 rows."
"143.0"," And 13 columns in our data set."
"145.52"," Now if I want to concise the summary of the column of my data frame for that I have"
"149.28"," data frame.info and inside info I'm passing null underscore count SQL proof."
"155.0"," So what it is exactly giving me it is giving how many non null values are up here."
"160.60000000000002"," So as you can see in Q sec we have 29 null values."
"163.4"," So from here you can say that we have three null values in our column Q sec."
"167.92000000000002"," Okay."
"169.04"," This is the data type of each column."
"171.35999999999999"," The first serial number is of integer data type next is object MP use object cylinder is"
"176.84"," integer and so on."
"178.23999999999998"," So in total we have four column which consists of floating data type."
"182.39999999999998"," Seven columns which consist of integer data and two column which consist of data of"
"187.68"," object data type."
"189.0"," Okay."
"190.0"," And the total memory user just 3.3 plus KB fine."
"194.12"," Let's move ahead."
"195.12"," Now if I want to calculate the mean of my data frame I can just write data frame dot"
"199.04"," mean which in our cases cast dot mean."
"202.08"," So as a part of output it gave me the mean of each column."
"205.72"," Okay."
"206.72"," Next if I want to calculate the median similarly data frame dot median cast dot median it"
"211.44"," gave me the median of each individual column."
"214.36"," Okay."
"215.36"," Next is standard deviation."
"217.16"," Well for standard deviation we have data frame dot STD."
"220.6"," So if you see the output over here you are getting the standard deviation of each column."
"224.8"," Fine."
"225.8"," Next similarly you can calculate the maximum value of each attribute by using data frame"
"230.44"," dot max."
"231.44"," So we have cast dot max for which we are getting maximum of each attribute."
"236.16000000000003"," So in serial number we have 35 unnamed maximum value this MPG is 33.9 and so on."
"242.56"," Okay."
"243.56"," Similarly you can calculate the minimum value for each attributes using data frame dot"
"246.96"," mean and you'll get minimum value for all these different attributes."
"251.64000000000001"," Fine."
"252.64000000000001"," Next is data frame dot count."
"254.36"," So if you want to count the total number of non null record in each column then you"
"258.40000000000003"," can use data frame dot count."
"260.56"," So which in our cases cast dot count."
"262.76"," So here as output we are getting how many non null values are in each column."
"268.36"," So here in QC you can see that we have 29 which suggests that we have only 29 non null"
"273.76"," records and there are three null values on it."
"276.84000000000003"," Okay."
"277.84000000000003"," Next is the data frame dot describe function."
"280.84000000000003"," Well it is used to print the descriptor statistic summary."
"284.28"," If you don't want to calculate each of the feature individually you can just write data"
"288.11999999999995"," frame dot describe and this will give you the output of count means standard deviation"
"293.03999999999996"," minimum maximum 25 percentile 50 percentile and 75 percentile values of all the different"
"298.76"," columns."
"299.76"," Okay."
"300.76"," So these were the various attributes you can use it for analyzing your data set."
"304.64"," Okay."
