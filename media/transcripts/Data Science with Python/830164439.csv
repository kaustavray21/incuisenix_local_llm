"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome all to this Python certification course."
"8.48"," In today's session we'll learn about data visualization basics and we'll cover topics"
"12.88"," like what is data visualization?"
"15.4"," Why do we even need to visualize our data and what are the various data visualization"
"19.6"," library in Python?"
"21.14"," So without delaying any further, let's start our session with what is data visualization?"
"27.12"," So data visualization is a representation of data in a pictorial or a graphical form"
"31.880000000000003"," heart."
"32.88"," It allows the decision makers to see analytics grasp difficult concepts and identify new"
"37.68"," patterns at ease."
"39.2"," Let me just show you an example of data visualization."
"42.36"," So let's say there's our data."
"44.24"," So our dataset consists of the name of the animal, speed, aggressiveness and size."
"49.8"," So now if I visualize my data, this would look something like this."
"53.6"," Right."
"54.6"," And see that both my data and the visualization consists of the same data."
"59.4"," So from this example, don't you think that visualizing our data is a better way to read"
"64.0"," and understand it?"
"65.0"," So let me make things more clear for you."
"67.16"," So let's understand why do we even need to visualize our data?"
"70.96000000000001"," So here's an example of Anzacombe's portrait."
"73.48"," Let's see."
"74.48"," So Anzacombe's portrait consists of four different dataset with almost identical statistics."
"79.36"," So here if you compare the sum, average and standard deviation of all the four dataset,"
"84.24"," they're almost identical."
"85.75999999999999"," Right."
"86.75999999999999"," So if you see the sum of all the coordinates of X and Y of dataset one, we are 99.0 and"
"92.64"," 82.5."
"93.64"," And similarly, some for all the X and Y coordinates for dataset two is 99.0 and 82.5."
"100.75999999999999"," So in all the dataset, the sum, average and standard deviation is exactly same."
"106.67999999999999"," But here's a catch."
"107.67999999999999"," Now if you plot all these points on a graph, you'll notice that all your plots are"
"111.8"," graph a completely different."
"113.76"," So this is my plot for my first dataset."
"116.72"," This one is for my second."
"118.28"," This one is third and this one is for the fourth one."
"120.92"," So even though the statistics for the data was so identical, but when we graphed it, all"
"125.92"," of them gave me a unique plot."
"127.76"," Thus, it's important to visualize our data."
"130.36"," Okay."
"131.36"," So I hope now you're convinced that why do we need to visualize our data?"
"133.96"," Right."
"134.96"," Let's move ahead."
"135.96"," Next is data visualization, nitrogen, python."
"138.88"," So we have Matlotlib, GGplot, bouquet, C-Bon, Geoplotlib and plotly."
"143.68"," So these are various open source data visualization library, which you can use to create various graphs"
"149.20000000000002"," and plots like bar chart, line chart, scatter plot and other various types of plots and"
"154.08"," python."
"155.08"," So in our next session, we'll learn about Matlotlib in detail and we'll see how to use"
"159.0"," it to create various graphs like line chart, bar graph and others."
"162.92000000000002"," Okay."
"163.92000000000002"," So this was all about the basics of data visualization."
"165.96"," So in our next session, we'll introduce you to Matlotlib and we'll see what exactly is"
"170.84"," Matlotlib and how to create various plots in it."
