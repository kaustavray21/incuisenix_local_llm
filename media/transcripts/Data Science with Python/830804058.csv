"0.0"," Hello everyone."
"6.88"," In this session, we are going to cover the basic probability concepts that are quite useful"
"10.68"," in data science."
"12.32"," So let's take a look at the agenda for this session."
"14.32"," So we're going to start with the basic introduction to probability."
"17.68"," And after that, we will discuss the various types of probability problems."
"22.400000000000002"," Moving further, we will cover conditional probability."
"25.400000000000002"," And in the end, we will cover based theorem with an example."
"28.56"," So let's begin with a simple introduction to probability for data science."
"32.56"," Probability in data science helps the data scientists gather useful insights about the"
"36.44"," data backed by evidence that in turn helps us evaluate the likelihood of events in a"
"43.12"," given problem statement."
"45.519999999999996"," When it comes to probability, a simple definition is that it is the certainty by which an event"
"51.96"," or outcome is likely to occur."
"55.0"," For example, if we roll a dice, what is the probability of rolling an event number?"
"61.16"," If we draw or you know, what is the probability if we draw a card from a deck, what is going"
"65.92"," to be the probability of drawing a face card?"
"69.24"," These are the sort of problems that we have in probability."
"72.68"," And now these probability problems can be of various types."
"76.03999999999999"," And we have summarized a few types of probability problems that we can assess."
"80.44"," But before that, let's also take a look at some of the common normenclature that is used"
"85.24"," while addressing problems related to probability."
"88.32"," So the first one that we have is experiment."
"90.72"," An experiment is an event where various outcomes are possible."
"94.44"," For example, rolling a failed dice is going to be an experiment."
"98.28"," Now event is something which is the favorable outcome."
"102.0"," For example, rolling a five in the experiment is going to be one event."
"106.56"," And outcome is the result of the experiment is the outcome."
"109.88"," Basically, when for example, where a failed dice was rolled, three had come, that is the"
"114.32000000000001"," outcome of the experiment."
"116.04"," And probability again is the likelihood of an event occurring that is called the probability."
"121.12"," For example, drawing a red card in a deck of cards has a probability of one by two."
"127.84"," Because we have 52 cards and 26 cards are red cards."
"132.16"," So drawing a red card would be one by 26, the beat."
"140.32"," So drawing a red card would be 26 by 52, which is one by two."
"144.24"," All right."
"145.24"," Now let's try to understand the various types of probability problems."
"150.6"," So when we talk about types of probability problems, they can be further divided into marginal"
"155.07999999999998"," joint or conditional probabilities."
"158.0"," So when we talk about marginal probability, the marginal probability of an event can be"
"163.68"," explained as the unconditional probability of an event occurring."
"168.24"," It means that the event does not depend on any other condition that can be seen with"
"173.6"," joint or conditional probability."
"175.92000000000002"," A very simple example would be what is the probability of drawing a red card from a"
"181.88"," deck of 52 cards."
"183.64"," Here, the event occurring does not depend on any other event."
"187.68"," So that is going to be the marginal probability."
"190.6"," Now when we talk about the joint probability, it is the intersection of two events happening"
"195.88"," simultaneously."
"196.88"," Now to understand this, let's take another example."
"201.32"," What is the probability of drawing a red card that is also a four from a deck of 52 cards."
"208.20000000000002"," So here, two events are there."
"210.24"," One is drawing a red card and one is drawing a four that is also a red."
"214.4"," So these are two events that are happening simultaneously."
"217.88"," Then we are conducting or we are calculating basically the joint probability of an event."
"223.44"," Now when we talk about conditional probability, it's a little trickier to understand, but"
"228.16"," it is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has occurred."
"234.48000000000002"," Now for example, what is the probability of drawing a four when the card drawn was already"
"240.36"," a red card."
"242.84"," So here, just a little bit of conflict here when we talk about joint and conditional"
"248.96"," probability."
"250.48000000000002"," In joint probability, the events are happening in tandem, but in conditional probability,"
"255.4"," we have to calculate the probability of an event knowing that another event has occurred."
"261.96"," And now that we have a fair understanding of types of probabilities, let's go ahead and"
"267.36"," understand conditional probability in detail."
"270.96"," So when we define conditional probability, we understand that it is given as the likelihood"
"276.32"," of an event a occurring given that an event b has already occurred."
"283.28"," And it is given as a or it is written as a probability of a given b where it equals to the"
"290.64"," probability of a and b, which is a intersection b and the probability of b, which is we are"
"296.84"," able to divide it by."
"299.08"," To understand this, let's again take a very small example."
"303.03999999999996"," So let us take an event a where a fair dice is rolled and five is drawn and an event"
"309.35999999999996"," b where an odd number is drawn."
"312.24"," Therefore, what is the probability of a given b?"
"316.64"," So here if we check the probability of the probability of event a, only one outcome of the six"
"322.7"," outcome is favorable."
"324.08"," Therefore, the probability will become one by six."
"326.68"," But if we bring in the event b, that is already occurred, the samples space can only have"
"332.32"," one outcome out of the three."
"334.16"," Therefore, the conditional probability of the event a given b occurs becomes one by three."
"340.52"," Now to understand this, let's just for a number to be odd as sample space, we only have"
"352.12"," three values, which is one three and five."
"354.56"," And we know that it has occurred, then the probability of a happening will become one"
"358.76"," by three because in the sample space, the intersection is just five."
"363.44"," And that is how we have come to the conclusion, the probability of event a given b, b, b,"
"367.68"," one by three."
"370.48"," Now to understand the practical implementation of conditional probability, let's take a"
"374.6"," look at base theorem and how it can be used in probability theory."
"381.6"," So in probability theory, base theorem is used to explain the likelihood of an event"
"386.48"," in a conditional probability, where the information about the other event is also given."
"391.96000000000004"," So the conditional probability of an event a given b, according to the base theorem is"
"396.48"," given by probability of b given a multiplied by probability of a and divided by probability"
"403.16"," of b."
"404.16"," As you can see in the formula over here, we have mentioned a and b are events, then probability"
"408.56"," of a given b is true, then probability of b given a is true, and the independent probabilities"
"412.92"," of a and b."
"413.92"," So these all information we need to calculate the conditional probability using base theorem."
"419.72"," Now to understand this again, let's take a simple example."
"423.4"," For a school, 10% of students failed all subjects in the examination out of all those"
"429.28"," students, 5% of the students failed in mathematics out of all the people who failed in all subjects,"
"436.84"," 8% of the students failed in mathematics."
"441.0"," So if a student fails in mathematics, what is the probability that he will fail in all subjects?"
"448.91999999999996"," So here we will use the base theorem to get the results."
"451.67999999999995"," First we will compute the probability of event a, which is given as 10%, that is 0.1."
"461.12"," Because we are going to check the event a is going to be what is the probability that"
"466.64"," he or she or the person will fail in all subjects."
"470.6"," So probability of that is already given, that is 10%, because 10% of students have already"
"474.44"," failed in all the examinations."
"477.92"," And we are going to take it as 0.1, then the event b, which is failing in mathematics,"
"484.12"," is given by 5%, which is 0.05, that is the probability of event b."
"489.68"," Now probability of b given a, that is person failing in mathematics, given that here"
"495.92"," is a failure in all subjects, that is given by 8%, that is 0.8, 0.08, I am sorry."
"505.92"," And finally we will put the formula to the test."
"508.88"," So our conditional probability for the given event will be 0.16 approximately and that is"
"514.44"," how you use a base theorem, according to base theorem, basically we have concluded."
"520.72"," If a student fails in mathematics, the probability of student failing in all subjects is going"
"525.1600000000001"," to be 16%."
"527.96"," So this is a very simple example of using base theorem."
"529.96"," And we will be revisiting many such examples and unique cases where conditional probability"
"534.8800000000001"," and a base theorem will be used in the additional hands on exercises for practice."
"539.44"," And with this we have come to the end of the session guys."
"541.68"," And the next session we are going to discuss probability distribution that will be helpful"
"545.28"," for us while performing inferential statistics, basically the hypothesis testing and various"
"550.76"," statistical test where we keep the samples and populations."
"556.7199999999999"," So thank you guys, thanks for watching, more of that in the upcoming session."
