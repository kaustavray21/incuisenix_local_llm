"0.0"," Hello everyone, welcome to the session where we will be covering inferential statistics."
"10.120000000000001"," This is the last session for this self-paced statistics and probability hands on."
"16.0"," And so let's take a look at the agenda for the session."
"19.96"," First of all, we are going to discuss what exactly is inferential statistics and how it is"
"23.56"," used in the science."
"25.240000000000002"," And then we are going to discuss confidence interval."
"28.08"," Following further, we are going to take a look at what exactly is hypothesis testing,"
"32.08"," the various types of errors that we have in hypothesis testing."
"36.44"," And after that, we will be taking a look at t test, f test, z test and chi square test."
"41.92"," And finally, we will be ending up this session with ANOVA."
"45.76"," So without any further ado, let's understand what is inferential statistics."
"54.04"," So the trial descriptive statistics describes the data."
"57.28"," inferential statistics is used to draw conclusions about the population based on statistical findings"
"61.64"," on sample analysis."
"63.96"," So this has a very simple meaning."
"66.88"," We have a sample taken from a population."
"69.28"," Now if you want to draw conclusions about the population, we will perform some sort of"
"74.36"," statistical test and then we will create inferences based on the findings."
"79.56"," So that is what inferential statistics is all about."
"84.52000000000001"," Now moving further, let's try to understand what exactly is confidence interval."
"90.68"," Confidence interval assumes certainty of population parameter falling in the given intervals."
"95.92"," The intervals could be 95% or 99% or so."
"100.08000000000001"," Normally in most of the problems, we take intervals as 95%."
"106.48"," The alpha value will be 0.05% for that."
"108.56"," We will be covering that later on in the session."
"111.96"," To understand confidence in the will, let's take a very simple example."
"116.16"," So if a point estimate 10.0 from the sample statistics for the confidence in double 95"
"123.08"," percent falls into 9.5 to 10.5, then we can infer that there is a 95% certainty that the"
"131.84"," true or population estimate will fall in the same interval."
"135.64"," Now to understand this, let's say for a sample, we have calculated the confidence in"
"140.4"," double which is 9.5 to 10.5."
"143.8"," And a point estimated for example is mean of the sample is 10.0."
"148.64000000000001"," So we can conclude or we can take an inference that if we take the population mean, it is"
"155.4"," going to fall in this particular interval and the certainty of happening that particular"
"161.68"," event is going to be 95%."
"165.08"," So that is how we can understand confidence in double."
"170.2"," Now to plot or basically implement confidence in double, we have taken a small snippet over"
"174.6"," here which we have implemented using Python programming."
"177.76"," We have taken a random normal samples of size 100 and calculated the lower confidence"
"182.95999999999998"," in double and upper confidence in double with the interval value of 95%."
"188.83999999999997"," Now if you take a look at the snippet over here, to calculate the confidence interval,"
"193.35999999999999"," we have taken the sample mean, the sample standard deviation and the standard error."
"197.68"," So these things are very important when you are taking confidence in double for any"
"201.52"," sample."
"202.52"," And then we have calculated the Z value as well which is nothing but the Z score where"
"206.96"," we would the sample mean and the standard deviation divided from the value itself."
"211.72"," And using that Z value and the standard error, we have basically computed lower confidence"
"217.68"," in double and upper count difference in double."
"220.24"," If you take a look at the example I was talking about earlier, the lower CIO is 9.5 and"
"225.56"," the upper CIO is 10.5."
"228.08"," Now using those lower CIO and upper CIO, we can plot the confidence in double over here"
"234.64000000000001"," and that is basically saying or telling us the sample mean is falling within this particular"
"241.32"," interval that we have calculated the lower CIO and the upper CIO."
"247.08"," Now according to our analysis, we can certainly say that there is a 95% certainty that the"
"253.52"," population mean will also be in the given interval because we have done the same thing"
"257.84000000000003"," on the sample."
"258.84000000000003"," So that is how confidence in double works and we can create inferences based on this."
"264.12"," And this was a very simple implementation using Python programming and we have normally"
"268.56"," used sci-fi for statistics and statistics module as well to calculate the sample standard"
"275.96000000000004"," deviation."
"277.56"," And to plot this, we have used the display that can be used using matplotlib or C-bone."
"289.4"," So now that we are done with confidence interval, let us move on and discuss hypothesis testing."
"295.6"," So hypothesis testing is the analysis where the possibility of an assumption for a population"
"300.24"," parameter is tested on the sample and statistical evidence is used to verify the hypothesis."
"306.88"," So I will give you a very simple example here."
"310.76000000000005"," So whenever we are working on a time series data, if you are using an REMA or a Syrimax"
"316.12"," model, that is seasonal REMA, we have to be certain that the time series data that we"
"322.6"," are going to analyze is stationary or not, you know, a test of stationarity where we use"
"328.72"," the AD fuller method."
"330.76"," Now in the AD fuller method, what we test is if our data is stationary or not."
"336.4"," Now that particular test gives us this test statistic and the p value."
"342.32"," So based on the p value, we reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis."
"348.8"," So what it actually means is using a statistical test that is I am performing on any sample,"
"354.64"," I can give an inference, you know, within evidence that is backed by evidence or you know,"
"359.64"," statistical finding that I have done from the test that will negate or accept some kind"
"367.88"," of hypothesis that I have given to that particular problem."
"371.4"," That we will cover later on the session when we are performing a test sample test for means"
"375.64"," and sample test for proportions and test of independence."
"381.47999999999996"," The example that I have given you is a little advanced one, whenever you are working on"
"385.12"," a time series, you will be using that."
"387.56"," Now talking about the steps involving hypothesis testing."
"391.48"," So the first one is you have to formulate two hypothesis for your analysis."
"396.2"," The first one is going to be the null hypothesis and the other one will be the alternate hypothesis"
"401.96"," and based on your findings, you have to reject or fail to reject your null hypothesis."
"408.64"," The second step is drawing samples from population for analysis."
"412.84"," So this has to be very efficient, you know, in a way where you have to be very certain"
"420.35999999999996"," of how you are doing your sampling for your analysis."
"423.67999999999995"," You know, most of these tests that we do for sample means we need a random sampling, you"
"428.64"," know, that we have discussed in one of the sessions where we are using sampling techniques."
"434.15999999999997"," So the sample has to be random taken independently and that we have to figure out before doing"
"438.96"," any of the tests."
"439.96"," That is also very important step when we are performing hypothesis testing."
"444.2"," After that we have to perform appropriate statistical test."
"447.23999999999995"," For example, samples that are less in number, let's say less than 30 or 30, we will be"
"453.52"," using or T test for means, but if samples are more than that, then we move on to Z test."
"459.2"," So that is one of the difference, you know, one of the basic points which we have to consider."
"464.32"," For each test, we have to keep in consideration what kind of data we are analyzing or"
"469.72"," what kind of result that we are seeking."
"473.64000000000004"," And last but not least, there is a step where we are accepting basically in statistical terms"
"478.6"," we do not say accept, we always say fail to reject or reject the hypothesis based on the"
"484.8"," evidence."
"485.8"," That is our any test statistic and the p value."
"489.12"," p value basically is nothing but let's say if I have taken the alpha value as 0.05 and"
"497.96"," if it does not fall under that, I can say with certainty that the statistical finding is"
"505.03999999999996"," not going to support hypothesis because that's what the p value says."
"510.91999999999996"," So now that we are done with the the steps involved hypothesis testing, let's take a look"
"516.52"," at what exactly is the null hypothesis and what exactly is alternate hypothesis."
"522.76"," So null hypothesis states that there is no effect on the population mean."
"526.84"," Certainly or in most of the time whenever we are taking null hypothesis, we go with the"
"533.08"," statements like it does not have any effect, the sample means are the same."
"540.92"," Or if we have to, you know, give any other alternate hypothesis, we basically go with statements"
"547.92"," like there is going to be an effect on population mean or the population means are not similar."
"554.1999999999999"," So that is how we formulate the null hypothesis and the alternate hypothesis."
"558.24"," There is just one example that we can have for null and I alternate hypothesis and when"
"564.68"," we are talking about errors in hypothesis testing, there are type 1 error and type 2 error."
"571.0799999999999"," Type 1 error is the false positive error where we have rejected the null hypothesis but it"
"576.64"," is indeed actually true and type 2 error is where we have given a false negative conclusion"
"582.4399999999999"," where we have not rejected the null hypothesis but it is actually false."
"591.48"," So these are the type 1 and type 2 error that we have in hypothesis testing and these are"
"597.4399999999999"," very basic concepts that we must, you know, consider while working with hypothesis testing"
"603.24"," because this is quite significant and talking about the p value, it is nothing but a statistical"
"609.8399999999999"," measurement that is going to valid data hypothesis against the observed data."
"614.8"," In simple terms, it basically tells you how likely it is that your data could have occurred"
"621.6"," in the under the null hypothesis."
"623.64"," All right, so if it falls under the alpha value that is 0.05, then we can reject the null"
"631.6"," hypothesis."
"632.6"," If it is more than that, then we accept or basically fail to reject null hypothesis."
"636.96"," Now, when I say fail or reject, let us say for example, if the p value is greater than"
"642.16"," 0.05 where we have taken the alpha value as 0.05 which means 95 percent certainty is the"
"648.4"," probability that the null hypothesis is true and for a statistically significant test result,"
"656.92"," p value has to be less than 0.05 which means the test hypothesis is false or should be"
"662.0"," rejected."
"665.0"," And p value greater than 0.05 basically means that there was no effect that was observed"
"670.52"," using that test."
"672.8399999999999"," And now that we know about all this, let us take a look at the first statistical test"
"677.36"," that we have which is t test."
"680.4"," So t test is a parametric test that compares the means of two samples."
"685.9599999999999"," And ideally, a sample for the test t test should have less than 30 values that we were discussing"
"691.88"," before."
"692.9599999999999"," And there are a few other assumptions also that we have to take before we can conduct the"
"696.72"," t test."
"697.72"," So obviously, when you when you are conducting any statistical test, you have to make sure"
"701.28"," that certain conditions are always met which basically means you have to check what kind"
"706.0"," of data that is supported for this particular statistical test."
"709.72"," So the other assumptions that we have in t test are sample has to be independent that"
"715.52"," is taken at random."
"717.1600000000001"," The homogeneity in the sample variances if we are taking two samples, the variance should"
"720.5600000000001"," be equal."
"721.5600000000001"," And if those are not equal for unequal variances, we have a Welsh test, Welsh t test."
"728.12"," And the third assumption is the data is assumed to be normal."
"730.6800000000001"," It is distributed."
"732.44"," So we assume that the norm distribution is going to be normal."
"736.9200000000001"," So these are the three assumptions that we have for t test."
"739.36"," Now let's just take a look at what kind of t test are available for us."
"742.8000000000001"," So we have one sample, two sample and paired."
"745.88"," So for a one sample t test, we are comparing a sample against a standard value."
"751.8000000000001"," So let's say if I want to check for my sample, if the mean has changed or not, you know,"
"759.2"," for a standard value, for example, let's say it was observed that the number of people"
"765.92"," that passed their SATs in the last year were 50% of the people who appeared."
"771.4799999999999"," So that is a standard value that I have."
"773.9599999999999"," Now I want to check it on my sample that I've taken the 30 values if the sample is same"
"779.0"," for those people or not."
"780.56"," So that is comparing the sample against a standard value."
"784.4799999999999"," So that comes under one sample t test."
"786.92"," And then we have two sample t test, of course, in which both the samples that we are comparing,"
"791.9599999999999"," you know, the means of are coming from two different populations."
"796.0400000000001"," And if we take those two samples from the same population, then it becomes a paired t test."
"801.36"," These are the type of t test available to us."
"804.2"," And then again, the type of test that you are performing can be one tail or two tail."
"809.6400000000001"," So this is a very simple yet interesting concept over here, one tail and two tail."
"816.0400000000001"," Well, let's say if I want to check whether the population means a greater than or smaller"
"819.36"," than the standard value in that one sample t test, I'll be using a one tail t test."
"824.36"," All right."
"825.36"," So if it gives me the value in the negative statistic, I will know that it is less than."
"829.8000000000001"," If it's in the positive size, I will know it is more than."
"834.48"," So that is why I will use one tail t test for a two tail t test."
"839.44"," I just want to check whether the population means differ significantly."
"842.88"," All right."
"843.88"," So we will just use the t test."
"845.4"," So the null hypothesis will be like both the sample means are equal."
"849.8000000000001"," The alternative one would be both the samples are not equal."
"853.36"," So that is how two tail and one tail t test works."
"856.24"," And computing the statistics for that is also really, we just have to divide the confidence"
"862.6"," interval by two because we are using one tail and two tail t test."
"866.96"," All right."
"868.84"," So now let's just take a few examples and implement them using Python programming so that"
"874.44"," we can understand this better."
"877.16"," So the first one is one sample t test."
"879.76"," Okay."
"880.76"," The average height of Indian adult males is 165 centimeter."
"884.76"," So that is our standard value."
"886.16"," So we have taken a standard value which is 165 centimeter for all the Indian adult males"
"891.16"," we are taking this."
"892.56"," Now we have to check or compare the mean of our sample with this standard value."
"897.24"," So our null hypothesis will be the average height is 165 centimeters."
"902.92"," The alternate hypothesis will be alternate height is not 165 centimeters."
"907.36"," All right."
"909.32"," So here we are using Python programming to perform the one sample t test."
"913.0"," Then again sci-fi dot statistics we have a t test one sample which is used for one sample"
"917.9200000000001"," t test."
"919.44"," And we are using random sample to get randomize samples for our statistical test over"
"926.32"," here."
"927.32"," So first of all we generate our random sample to get the heights, you know the randomized"
"930.72"," heights and we calculate the sample mean because we also need the sample mean for one sample"
"934.96"," test."
"936.76"," And our population mean we already know it's 165 that is the standard value that we have"
"941.4399999999999"," for our test over here."
"942.88"," And we use the t test one sample and statistics are minus 2.06 and the p value is also less"
"949.72"," than 0.05."
"951.28"," So what we can say about this is since the p value is less than 0.05 we will reject the"
"957.12"," null hypothesis and we will conclude that the average height is not 165 centimeters."
"965.4399999999999"," All right."
"966.44"," And if I wanted to you know perform a one tail test, let's say if I wanted to check if"
"971.08"," it is less than or greater than 165 then I would have used the test statistics over here"
"977.36"," which is in given in minus 2 which probably now since we were not doing our one sample test,"
"983.9200000000001"," one sample t test."
"985.5200000000001"," This test statistic in minus or negative or in positive does not create any significance."
"991.2"," We just want to know if the means are basically different than the standard value that we"
"998.6800000000001"," are comparing to and without finding over here we can say that that is not true for our"
"1005.12"," sample at least."
"1006.96"," So that is how one sample t test can tell us a few things about your sample and same"
"1011.76"," thing you can infer for your population."
"1014.5200000000001"," Let's say if we had taken these values of population we can conclude that this particular"
"1020.24"," standard value is not true."
"1022.84"," All right."
"1024.84"," So let's take a look at the next one that we have which is the two sample t test."
"1029.4"," So here we have to check whether the mean of or the mean height of adult means in both"
"1034.0"," the schools is same or not."
"1035.72"," Now schools in this case are two different populations."
"1038.6"," All right."
"1039.6"," So this is a two sample t test."
"1043.28"," If we had taken the samples from the same school which is the same population let's say"
"1047.68"," then it would have again a pair t test."
"1050.72"," Now our null hypothesis is the means are equal and the alternate hypothesis is the means"
"1056.96"," are not equal."
"1059.28"," Then again this is a two two tail t test."
"1064.28"," And here again we have we are going to check the variance of each group so we have to"
"1067.88"," make sure that the variance is are equal."
"1070.4"," And if the ratio is in the first one then we can basically assume that the variance"
"1076.6"," is are equal and we can go ahead with the two sample t test."
"1079.6399999999999"," Otherwise we will compute a well state test."
"1084.24"," So when we have calculated the variances it almost seems like in the same ratio."
"1088.0"," So we will conclude that the variances are equal and using that si pi starts we have"
"1092.24"," a test t test independent i and e basically."
"1096.28"," So that is going to be used for two sample t test where we are giving sample one two"
"1100.0"," and the equal variances we are giving it as true because that is what we have concluded."
"1104.76"," So the statistic and the p value is more than 0.05."
"1109.04"," So we can say we have insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis."
"1116.32"," So we have to conclude that means are equal because we fail to reject the null hypothesis"
"1123.72"," and this is a very simple and basic example of how you can form a two sample t test."
"1130.24"," Now moving further for a paid two sample t test what we have to check is if the mean"
"1136.56"," of heights of males and females are same in the school."
"1140.1200000000001"," So here the samples are coming from the same population."
"1143.0"," So the null hypothesis is going to mean the means are equal and the alternate hypothesis"
"1147.2"," is going to be the means are not equal."
"1150.96"," Alright so we have a paired sample t test for us where we have two samples basically the"
"1156.92"," sample for all the heights with female and all the heights of male and we have taken"
"1162.04"," again the random module for creating the sample and we have no repetitions in this because"
"1168.4"," we will be using sample over here but if we had used the choices we could have hard repetitions"
"1173.48"," as well."
"1174.48"," So this is kind of a sampling bias that will be present in our samples but just to demonstrate"
"1179.68"," how you perform sample and just to demonstrate how you can perform these tests we have taken"
"1185.44"," these random samples."
"1187.2"," Now we have a sci-fi statistic module or a function which is t test underscore r here which"
"1194.3600000000001"," we can use to perform paid t tests."
"1197.72"," And here again you don't have to give anything just your samples and it will give you the test"
"1201.0800000000002"," statistic and the p value and p value is much less than 0.05 so we have sufficient edge"
"1208.8"," evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the means are not equal."
"1215.72"," So this is all about the t test guys now moving further let's discuss f test and f test is a"
"1222.92"," static statistical test that is used to compare the variances of two populations."
"1228.1200000000001"," Now this is something different first in the t test we were comparing the means basically"
"1233.96"," the average values of the samples and we were using that to conclude or make inferences"
"1239.92"," about the population but now we are testing or basically comparing the variances of the"
"1245.88"," two populations so this is a different kind of test and then again we have to make several"
"1250.6000000000001"," assumptions about the data before we can begin with the test."
"1256.0"," So the assumptions are basically the data has to be normally distributed and the data"
"1260.76"," has to be independent so we have to take random samples basically independently and make"
"1267.0800000000002"," sure that the data is normally distributed."
"1269.48"," So even if it's not we'll just assume for now that the data is normally distributed"
"1273.2"," so that we do not have any shortcomings while we are performing the statistical test."
"1279.0"," But this is just for demonstration guys if you are doing it for your project or some"
"1285.16"," very important task that you have to analyze please make sure that these two assumptions"
"1289.3600000000001"," are met before you move on with the f test."
"1292.32"," So here for the example for this example we have to check if the variances of the two"
"1298.08"," populations where the groups are taken from are equal or not."
"1301.24"," This is a very simple problem statement where the null hypothesis is going to be the variances"
"1306.48"," are equal and alternate hypothesis is going to be the variances are not equal."
"1312.8799999999999"," Now again we have this code snippet where we are just calculating the variances of the"
"1316.56"," two samples and computing the f statistic and p value."
"1320.8"," So to do this we have we are using this statistics module."
"1328.96"," So we have already calculated the f value just calculating the p value from CDF function"
"1334.08"," over here where we are using the degree of freedom and the f statistic."
"1339.08"," So that is how we are calculating."
"1340.84"," So the f value for our statistical test over here is 1.03 and so on and the p value is"
"1345.9199999999998"," 0.46 and so on."
"1348.48"," So since the p value is not less than 0.05 we have no sufficient evidence or we do not"
"1356.76"," have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and we will have to conclude that the variances"
"1361.56"," are in a indeed equal."
"1364.44"," So that is a simple way to perform an f test and then again we have analysis of variance."
"1372.24"," So analysis of variance is basically a statistical test that compares the means of two or more"
"1380.16"," groups to find significance or either groups on one another or how different they are from"
"1387.72"," each other basically."
"1389.88"," So in the f test what we were doing we were comparing the variances of just two populations"
"1397.8"," right if we wanted to compare two or more groups we would use ANOVA."
"1402.52"," Also again here we have to take a few assumptions which is first of all independent samples."
"1408.08"," So sampling has to be random and the populations will have common variance and samples are"
"1414.9199999999998"," going to be drawn from normally distributed population."
"1418.8799999999999"," So this is quite a lot of you know pre-requited data required for analysis of variance and we"
"1426.16"," have to make sure that these are met only after that we have to proceed with the statistical"
"1431.8000000000002"," test."
"1432.8000000000002"," So then again we have two kind of ANOVA which is 1,2 and 2 and 1."
"1439.16"," So let us understand 1,2 and 2 with a few examples."
"1443.3600000000001"," So let us say we have to check if the effect of four different performance enhancers on an"
"1447.68"," electric vehicle is same or not."
"1449.92"," So as you can see we are checking the effect of four different performance enhancers."
"1454.28"," So these are four groups."
"1456.28"," Earlier if you wanted to compare the variances or the means or anything we were checking"
"1461.08"," just the two groups."
"1462.08"," If you want to check it for more than two groups we are using analysis of variance."
"1466.04"," So the null hypothesis is simple the performance averages are equal and the alternate hypothesis"
"1472.04"," is this the performance averages are not equal."
"1474.8799999999999"," Now let us see how we can implement the same in Python programming."
"1479.12"," So we have taken four random samples that hypothetically let us just assume that these are the"
"1483.96"," performance values for so and so groups that we are basically testing and we are going"
"1489.52"," to calculate the test statistics and p value."
"1493.1200000000001"," So we have a function from statistics again the scipy module that is called f1 way for"
"1500.6000000000001"," 1 way ANOVA where we are just putting the four samples and using that we are getting"
"1504.76"," up one way result where the test statistic is 3.10 and so on."
"1509.52"," The p value is again less than 0.05."
"1513.32"," So since it is less than 0.05 we can reject the null hypothesis which says or our conclusion"
"1520.9199999999998"," would be the performance averages are not equal."
"1523.96"," So this is a very simple example of one way ANOVA."
"1526.76"," Then again let us take a look at what does two way ANOVA look like and how do you perform"
"1531.1599999999999"," a test regarding that."
"1533.4399999999998"," So for two ANOVA basically let us say we have to check how two factors will affect the"
"1538.48"," response variable."
"1539.96"," You know there are going to be two factors."
"1541.96"," Now here only the performance and answers were there."
"1544.72"," We will add one more factor for that and both are going to be the categorical factors that"
"1548.88"," we are going to use in this."
"1551.08"," So we have to check how is it going to affect the response variable."
"1555.0"," The null hypothesis is that there is no significance of the two factors on response variable."
"1559.48"," The alternate hypothesis is there is significance."
"1561.8400000000001"," We have kept it very simple for you to understand."
"1564.8"," No."
"1566.44"," Also for what we have done is we have created a data frame which has lectures, tuition"
"1574.56"," and marks."
"1575.64"," So we have to check how lectures and marks are affecting the how lectures and the tuition."
"1583.6000000000001"," You know the frequency of that is affecting the marks of an individual."
"1587.92"," So we have two factors."
"1589.8400000000001"," So that is why it is called two way ANOVA or two factor ANOVA and we are performing"
"1593.92"," it using an OLS model over here which is a starts model formula API module and this"
"1602.3600000000001"," is a rather advanced concept."
"1604.52"," So if you haven't covered well in regression and all those things, I suggest you do a little"
"1610.96"," bit of research on that before moving on to just avoid a little bit of confusion."
"1616.48"," So here what we have done is calculated the model over here where we have marks, lectures,"
"1622.68"," tuition and etc."
"1624.68"," So and then we are fitting it into the model."
"1627.76"," Now to perform the two way ANOVA we are using this start models API again for ANOVA LM which"
"1635.16"," is calculating the statistics."
"1637.68"," So here if you see in the picture we have the degree of freedom, the F statistics and"
"1643.0800000000002"," the P value for lectures and tuition it is not less than 0.05 for combined also we do"
"1649.3200000000002"," not have less than 0.05."
"1652.24"," So there is no significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis."
"1657.2"," So what it actually means is there is significance of the two factors on the response variable."
"1664.24"," So as you can see the P value for the lectures basically is 0.29 the P value for tuition"
"1671.04"," is 0.29 and the combined P value is also 0.18 which is not less than 0.05."
"1678.08"," So we have no evidence to reject the null hypothesis which basically means that there is no"
"1682.8799999999999"," significance of the two factors on the response variable."
"1686.76"," So that is how we have calculated the two way ANOVA and let us now move on to the Z test"
"1693.8"," over here in which Z test is basically a statistical test to compare the means of populations"
"1701.08"," where the variance is unknown and samples sizes are considerably larger compared to T test."
"1706.96"," So for T test the sample size was less than 30 that was the ideal sample size."
"1713.04"," If we have samples more than that in size then we go first that test which is also a statistical"
"1717.56"," test comparing the means of populations."
"1719.92"," We also do that for proportions we will see how we do that later on."
"1724.8"," And then again we have assumptions for Z test again."
"1727.32"," So first one is standard deviation and variance are known and population should be 10 times"
"1733.16"," as much as the sample size."
"1734.76"," And the third one is samples are drawn at random from the population then again independent"
"1739.0800000000002"," samples."
"1740.0800000000002"," So these are the assumptions you have to keep in mind while doing a Z test."
"1745.88"," Let us go ahead and understand what one sample Z test for means how do you perform that."
"1751.16"," So let us say the average weight of the high schoolers pre pandemic was 55 kg with a standard"
"1757.52"," deviation of 8 and we just have to check has it changed post pandemic."
"1762.04"," Then again we are just testing it against a standard value."
"1765.56"," All right."
"1766.56"," So the null hypothesis is the average weight is same."
"1769.68"," The alternate hypothesis is the average weight is not the same."
"1773.52"," So we have kept it very simple."
"1775.56"," Now to implement this using Python we will use a ensemble Z test that we can get using"
"1781.36"," stats models dot stats dot weight stats and that gives us Z test."
"1787.68"," We don't have to do anything we have just taken a random sample over here."
"1791.2"," We are using the sample the value basically is the standard value that we are comparing"
"1795.52"," it against with that is 55."
"1798.16"," Now our test statistic is 0.24 in the negative and the P value is 0.80 which is not less than"
"1805.96"," 0.05."
"1807.3600000000001"," So we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis."
"1810.1200000000001"," So we will have to accept the null hypothesis which says the average weight is same."
"1814.92"," And this is just to demonstrate how it works."
"1817.28"," So obviously there is sampling bias over here because we have just taken a random sample"
"1822.3999999999999"," that does not come from a population."
"1824.04"," So we just explaining how you can perform a one sample Z test means."
"1830.3999999999999"," And after this let's take a look at how you can form a two sample Z test for means."
"1835.8799999999999"," So the problem statement is is the average height post pandemic for high schoolers going"
"1842.08"," to school A and school B is same."
"1845.76"," And that the standard deviation of the populations is known."
"1849.12"," All right."
"1850.12"," So let's say the mean difference is 0 that is our null hypothesis because we are comparing"
"1854.76"," two means from populations."
"1856.68"," So if we take the mean difference it was always going to be 0 if the means are equal."
"1862.8"," And the mean difference is not 0 for alternate hypothesis."
"1866.12"," All right."
"1867.12"," So how we implemented it in Python we have taken one sample from each of the populations"
"1870.72"," with 15 individual C's because it has to be more than 30 for a Z test."
"1876.48"," And then performing a two sample Z test using Python then again we are using the same method"
"1881.64"," or you know the same function that we had used for one sample Z test."
"1886.44"," So here we have taken two samples."
"1888.28"," Chumple one and sample two for value we have taken 0 because they're supposed to take"
"1892.52"," the mean difference is equal to 0 that is what we are testing."
"1895.92"," And here we have this P value 0.61 which is not less than 0.05."
"1901.0800000000002"," So we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis."
"1904.96"," And here again we will have to accept or fail to reject basically and conclude that the"
"1909.92"," mean difference is 0."
"1912.28"," So that is how you calculate two samples at test for means."
"1915.88"," And also this is just to demonstrate."
"1917.72"," So whenever you are performing statistical test for samples that come from real populations"
"1925.48"," test statistic and the P value are going to be very significantly important and you should"
"1930.6"," know how to evaluate those."
"1933.92"," And sometimes the values will be so drastically fluctuating with each sample because of"
"1941.0"," sampling bias or sometimes you must have taken wrong samples."
"1945.1200000000001"," So those things also happen."
"1946.92"," This is just to demonstrate how you can perform it using Python."
"1951.96"," Moving on to one sample Z test for proportion."
"1954.72"," Now this is a rather interesting one."
"1956.72"," So let's say it was observed from a purchase case study that 35% of women spend more than"
"1962.8"," 10,000 on a purchase."
"1967.0"," And we just have to check that is it true for the population in the analysis."
"1971.6000000000001"," Right."
"1972.6000000000001"," So the statement this 35% of women spending more than 10,000 is a vague statement where we"
"1978.68"," are going to base our null hypothesis which is saying the proportion is same for our population"
"1985.4"," as well."
"1987.0"," And the alternate hypothesis is the proportion is not same."
"1990.48"," So here we perform the Z test for proportion."
"1995.3600000000001"," So here we have used a sample data which has a lot of information regarding the purchase"
"2000.3600000000001"," values of different individuals within age groups."
"2003.8"," And here we have basically taken the number of women in the sample, the number of observations,"
"2010.12"," the hypothesized value which is 0.35 which is 35% and from the Z test we are using the"
"2017.44"," proportions Z test function from stat models."
"2022.0"," So here the important factors are the count."
"2024.84"," Basically the number of women in the sample."
"2027.0"," All right."
"2028.0"," We have to take the number of observations."
"2030.12"," Basically how many observations are there where we are taking only the women, you know"
"2034.56"," the proportions because we have to check they might be males also."
"2038.56"," And the value the hypothesized value which is 0.35 the alternative to cited because we do"
"2043.6"," not want one cited."
"2045.08"," We are just checking if it's same or not."
"2047.08"," All right."
"2048.08"," And proposed variance is false because we are assuming that the variances are equal the"
"2054.72"," population variances."
"2056.56"," Now we print the Z statistic and the p value."
"2058.92"," The p value is 0 which is less than 0.05."
"2063.2799999999997"," So since the p value is less than 0.05 we can reject the hypothesis."
"2068.64"," And we can say the proportions is not the same for our population."
"2076.04"," Moving further we have the two samples Z test for proportion."
"2079.96"," So in this we are just going to check is the percentage of men who have spent more than"
"2085.32"," 10,000."
"2086.32"," Same for the ages of 18 to 25 and 26 to 35."
"2092.6000000000004"," So here we have two samples."
"2094.6400000000003"," The men in the age group 18 to 25 and the men in the age group 26 to 35."
"2102.2400000000002"," So the null hypothesis is the proportions are same."
"2105.8"," Outenate hypothesis is the proportion is not same."
"2110.6000000000004"," Then again to perform this we are taking the two samples again."
"2114.36"," The age basically and the purchase they should have bought more than 10,000."
"2119.2400000000002"," These are the and then again we have sampled those people just taking a random thousand"
"2125.6400000000003"," samples from that."
"2127.28"," The count we have conducted for each of the samples because we have to know those have"
"2131.88"," to be men those could be women also and the number of observations again."
"2137.92"," And then we have the proportions Z test where we have the number of counts and everything"
"2143.92"," else remains same."
"2145.56"," We are checking the statistics and the p value."
"2150.4"," So if we take a look at the statistics and the p value the test statistics is 0.5 and"
"2155.12"," the p value is 0.6 which is not less than 0.05."
"2158.16"," So we fail to reject the null hypothesis again and we have to conclude that the proportion"
"2163.64"," is same."
"2166.4"," And I think in the one test sample p value was less than 0.05."
"2171.84"," So we had rejected all right."
"2175.8"," So with this we have come to the end of RZ test again and now we have to move for chi"
"2180.52"," square test."
"2181.88"," So chi square test is for categorical data itself and it can be used to check the goodness"
"2187.96"," of fit or the test of independence."
"2190.48"," So in our session we will go through the test of independence."
"2193.96"," Then again we have to take a look at a few assumptions that we have to take before moving"
"2197.7200000000003"," forward with chi square test."
"2199.76"," So the first one is the features are categorical in nature."
"2202.7200000000003"," The features are going to be categorical in nature."
"2205.88"," The samples are going to be taken at random and minimum of five observations are expected"
"2211.0800000000004"," in each group."
"2214.6400000000003"," So when we perform the chi square test of independence."
"2217.96"," So this is also taken from a case study."
"2220.36"," The same case study where we were performing the proportions test."
"2224.36"," So we just want to check if purchase a feature from that particular data of the population"
"2229.96"," is independent of product category one or not."
"2232.48"," So these are two features that we are testing."
"2234.6400000000003"," Basically testing the test of independence."
"2238.04"," The null hypothesis is going to be purchase and product category one are not related at"
"2242.2400000000002"," all."
"2243.2400000000002"," And the alternate hypothesis is purchase and product category one are related."
"2249.28"," So that is how we move forward."
"2251.2400000000002"," Now to perform the test of flow independence."
"2254.16"," We have to take a cross table for each of these two variables or features."
"2261.72"," And then we are using the chi square contingency function of we have for the cross table that"
"2265.24"," we have completed here."
"2267.8399999999997"," We have the p value is equal to 0.0 and the degree of freedom is 19."
"2272.44"," And we have a test statistic also."
"2274.24"," So we can check the test statistic in the distribution table."
"2277.7599999999998"," And for the degrees of freedom, if it is less than or equal to two base or conclusions."
"2282.28"," So the p value tells us that it is 0.0.0.5."
"2286.6800000000003"," So we can reject the null hypothesis which basically says that purchase and product category"
"2290.6800000000003"," one are related."
"2292.96"," So that is a simple example of how we can perform a chi square test of independence."
"2297.88"," And with this we have come to the end of the session guys."
"2299.92"," I hope this entire statistics and probability session has been helpful for you."
"2307.2000000000003"," So thank you guys."
"2308.2000000000003"," Thanks a lot."
