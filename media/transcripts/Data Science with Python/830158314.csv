"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome back to our Python certification course."
"8.64"," In the previous session we learned about NumPyAreaInspection and we discussed about various"
"13.5"," NumPy functions such as shape, resize, size, data type and all."
"19.64"," Right, I hope those things are clear to you."
"22.48"," So if not, I'd suggest you to revisit the session and learn it once again."
"26.88"," And even then if you're facing some issues, come back to us and we'll try to resolve"
"31.2"," your issue at the earliest."
"33.16"," Okay, so for today's session we'll learn about NumPyAreaMethmatics."
"37.56"," We'll see what are the various mathematical functions that we can perform using NumPy."
"42.32"," Okay, so let's see."
"47.04"," So first we have is addition using NumPy."
"50.599999999999994"," So for performing some addition we have a some function up here."
"54.52"," Let's see how does it work?"
"62.36"," NumPyAreaMethmatics and in this we are learning about addition."
"68.36"," Okay, import NumPyAsNP."
"74.0"," You can write any name apart from NP if you write any that is also fine."
"77.72"," We are just following the convention and writing NP up here."
"80.60000000000001"," Okay, so now what if I want to find the sum of two numbers?"
"83.88"," So what I'll do, I'll call this sum function."
"86.28"," So I can call NP.Sum."
"88.88"," NP.Sum inside that sum of two numbers, what are those two numbers?"
"93.44"," Ten and twenty."
"94.44"," It'll just give me the result as thirty as simple as that."
"98.67999999999999"," You can even use a variable like using a variable."
"103.47999999999999"," So let's define a comma b equal 10 comma 20 and NP.Sum."
"110.92"," I want to sum of a plus b using a variable that is sum of a plus b."
"119.12"," Okay, so Np.Sum a comma b executed."
"122.88"," What error did we got?"
"124.08"," Axis 20 out of bonds for area of dimension zero."
"128.4"," So always remember whenever you are writing some parameter inside the sum, make sure that"
"133.4"," you are placing them inside the square brackets."
"136.24"," Okay."
"137.24"," The sum function only takes the area of values."
"140.20000000000002"," Okay, so now if I executed the error would be resolved."
"143.96"," Okay, so we got the value as thirty."
"146.8"," Now what if I want to find the sum of a particular axis?"
"150.48000000000002"," Like I have a two cross two matrix and inside that I want to find the sum of just my first"
"156.08"," axis or just my first column."
"158.48000000000002"," Let's see how we can do it."
"161.60000000000002"," So here let's define Np.Sum inside that."
"166.76"," Let's pass some array like one comma two and another array like five comma six."
"175.28"," Okay, so now what if I want to print the sum of five plus one and six plus two."
"181.44"," So in that case, I'll just mention like axis equal zero."
"185.88"," Okay, so you'll get the output as six comma eight five plus one six and six plus two eight."
"191.72"," Now what if I want to print the value of one plus two and five plus six."
"196.8"," So in that case, Np dot sum array of one comma two, same number."
"202.64"," I think need to be changed."
"204.2"," Just the axis value would change."
"205.68"," Okay, five comma six."
"208.36"," Now specify the axis value as one."
"212.04"," This is the only change that you have to do."
"214.52"," So here you'll get the output as three and six plus five eleven."
"218.92"," So you got the output as three comma eleven."
"222.11999999999998"," Correct."
"223.11999999999998"," Now what if I don't specify the axis up here?"
"226.32"," So what values do you think I'll get?"
"228.32"," What if I remove this?"
"230.32"," Let's see."
"231.32"," So I got the value as 14."
"233.39999999999998"," How?"
"234.39999999999998"," So it summed up one plus two plus five plus six."
"236.95999999999998"," So it gave me the entire sum of all the elements of the array."
"240.11999999999998"," That is one plus two plus five plus six."
"242.0"," That is 14, okay?"
"244.48"," Similarly like sum, we have other important function up here."
"248.0"," Like subtract divide multiply exponent square root sine function, cos function log function"
"253.88"," and many more."
"254.88"," Let's see some of them."
"256.08"," Now, let's copy up this title."
"260.08"," I'm by a re addition here."
"262.04"," What we are performing."
"263.4"," Let's change it to subtraction now to perform subtraction."
"267.28"," We have a method as so we have to call the function subtractor."
"271.4"," Let's see an example like Np dot subtract."
"275.64"," What do you want to subtract?"
"277.28"," Like any value of like 10 comma 20."
"281.28"," So we'll get the output as minus 10 minus 20."
"285.35999999999996"," So you got the value as minus 10, okay?"
"288.47999999999996"," Similarly, what if I want to find the multiplication of two number?"
"292.32"," I'll just write Np dot multiply to comma three."
"296.52"," Let's take two number multiplication of two number."
"300.0"," So we'll get the output as six."
"304.16"," Let me just add one more heading up here."
"309.6"," All other numbering, mathematics function."
"318.48"," So inside this we saw for multiply."
"321.6"," Now let's check out for division."
"324.04"," So, so for dividing two numbers, we have function as divide."
"328.44000000000005"," So Np dot divide divide what?"
"331.8"," Let's divide 10 by 5."
"333.84000000000003"," Here we are doing we are dividing two numbers."
"338.0"," Okay, let's execute it."
"340.8"," So we got the result as 2.0."
"342.68"," Okay?"
"343.68"," So here all the operation that we perform with sum can also be performed with subtract,"
"348.92"," multiply, divide or anything."
"350.84000000000003"," Okay?"
"351.84000000000003"," It's like here we use a variable."
"354.2"," So here we are summing up two array with axis zero."
"357.16"," Here we are summing up axis one."
"359.2"," So all those function can even be done with Np dot subtract, Np dot multiply or Np dot"
"364.76"," divide."
"365.76"," Let me just show you with one example."
"367.68"," Let's just copy it and let's paste it up here."
"371.12"," So instead of sum, let's change it to divide and execute it in valid number of arguments."
"378.12"," Now let me just show you how you can divide two arrays."
"381.2"," So let's define two array up here like a equal Np dot array."
"386.84"," It consists of two, four and six."
"390.36"," Okay?"
"391.36"," And other array b equal Np dot array inside this."
"398.32"," That's 1, 2, 3."
"401.4"," Now let's divide array a with array b."
"403.96"," So Np dot divide array a with array b."
"409.28"," Let's see what result do we get."
"411.35999999999996"," So we got the divided result of two different arrays."
"415.0"," Fine?"
"416.0"," Similar operation we can perform with multiplication."
"419.64"," So we got the value as 2, 8 and 6, 3 is a 80."
"424.28"," Okay?"
"425.28"," So we also have other function as exponent, square root, sine, cos and log."
"430.44"," So let's see them one by one."
"431.71999999999997"," So all you have to do is change the function."
"434.11999999999995"," So we have exponent function for calculating the exponents."
"438.16"," So we have exp function for calculating the exponents, sqrt function for calculating"
"443.96000000000004"," the square root sine function for finding out the sine value of an array."
"448.72"," Similarly, cos function for finding out the cos value of the array and similarly log"
"453.20000000000005"," function to find out the log value of the array."
"456.04"," Let's see them one by one."
"457.48"," Again."
"458.48"," So there's our array."
"459.48"," We have already defined it."
"461.08000000000004"," So let's use all these functions one by one."
"464.04"," Print Np dot exponent of a."
"467.52000000000004"," Okay?"
"468.48"," Execute it."
"469.48"," So this is the exponent of a."
"472.36"," That is e to the power a."
"473.96000000000004"," Okay?"
"474.96000000000004"," e to the power 2 is 7.38."
"475.96000000000004"," e to the power 4 is 54.5."
"479.20000000000005"," e to the power 6 is 403.42."
"481.96000000000004"," Okay?"
"482.96000000000004"," Let's just copy this function and let's find the square root of all the elements of a."
"488.32"," So sqrt."
"490.16"," So there's our square root."
"492.20000000000005"," Let's add one more thing."
"493.96000000000004"," This will make things more clear."
"496.36"," Where root and here it was exponent."
"503.36"," Okay?"
"504.36"," Copy this."
"506.0"," Now we'll calculate the sine."
"511.72"," Sine is np dot sine value of a."
"515.28"," Again, we have to check for cos."
"519.88"," So cos is np dot cos and finally log."
"527.08"," So we have log as np dot log."
"531.08"," Okay?"
"532.08"," Execute it."
"533.08"," So we got all the values of here."
"534.4"," The exponent is this, square root is this, sine of 2 4 6 is this cos of 2 4 6 log of 2 4 6."
"544.12"," Okay?"
"545.12"," So these are some of the mathematical function that you can perform using np."
"548.92"," So let's move ahead."
"550.24"," Let's go back to our pbd."
"552.32"," So we already discussed this part and we also learned about all these different types"
"557.5600000000001"," of other function that you can perform and we also discussed about the error that you"
"561.6"," might get."
"562.6"," So let's move ahead."
"563.6"," So next we have is the array comparison."
"566.44"," So in this we have element wise comparison and array wise comparison."
"570.96"," Let's see them one by one."
"578.76"," So here we have is a comparison."
"586.24"," So let's define two or three arrays."
"588.64"," So a equal like 1 2 4."
"592.52"," Let's define b."
"593.88"," b equal to 4 6."
"596.88"," Let's define one more."
"599.3199999999999"," c equal again 1 2 and 4."
"603.0"," Same as a."
"604.0"," Okay?"
"605.0"," Let's use numpy to perform an element wise comparison of these arrays."
"609.28"," So for this I'll write np dot equal."
"612.6"," Let's write a comma b."
"615.56"," So it will compare one with two, two with four and four with six."
"619.52"," So if these two element are equal it will return true."
"622.8"," In other case false."
"624.64"," So for now what output do you think we'll get?"
"627.6"," Well for now all the output would be false."
"630.8"," It has one is not equal to two, two is not equal to four and four is not equal to six."
"635.3199999999999"," But what if we change this b to c?"
"637.92"," So in this case you'll get all the true values."
"641.16"," Just for understanding just change this six to four."
"644.28"," Now let's compare a with b."
"647.24"," So in this case we have last as true."
"649.64"," So these two are false and one is true."
"651.76"," So two false and one true value."
"654.8"," So two false and one true."
"656.9599999999999"," Correct."
"657.9599999999999"," So this was about the."
"660.76"," So this is the second wise comparison."
"667.76"," Okay."
"668.76"," Now next we'll see."
"671.76"," Now next let's perform a array wise comparison."
"677.76"," Okay."
"678.76"," Let's just copy them."
"682.76"," Now in this I want to compare the entire array."
"685.96"," If all the elements of array a equal to all the elements of array b then only in that case"
"691.9200000000001"," we'll get the output as true and all the other case we'll get the output as false."
"697.2"," Let me just show you this example."
"699.1600000000001"," So np dot array underscore equal."
"703.08"," So this is the function that we are going to use for comparing to arrays."
"706.0"," So this compare a and b."
"708.4000000000001"," Even if one of the element is different we'll get the output as false."
"711.76"," So here we got the output as false."
"714.0"," See executed false."
"716.28"," So here what we have a one to four and b one for four."
"720.1600000000001"," So we had two elements equal in a and b right just two and four were different and even"
"726.52"," then we are getting false."
"727.96"," What if I just change the value to see."
"729.84"," So in this case we'll get the output as true."
"732.0400000000001"," Correct."
"733.0400000000001"," So this was about array wise comparison."
"735.96"," So now that we have learned how to compare two arrays both element wise and array wise."
"741.5600000000001"," So let's move ahead and see what we have next."
"744.56"," So we are done with this example."
"747.0799999999999"," Next we have is the aggregate function."
"749.56"," So under this we'll see how to perform various statistical calculations on the array."
"754.52"," Okay."
"755.52"," Let me show you with an example."
"758.3199999999999"," Okay."
"760.3199999999999"," Function."
"762.92"," So here that's again copy paste the value of a b and c."
"767.64"," So in aggregate function model things we can do."
"770.96"," We can perform a array wise sum or we can find the minimum value of an array or the mean"
"775.36"," of a array, the median or correlation coefficient of array or even the standard deviation of the"
"780.88"," array."
"781.88"," All right."
"782.88"," Let's print all of them one by one."
"783.88"," So here I want to print my sum."
"786.6800000000001"," So print np dot sum of array a."
"791.08"," So it will give me the sum right."
"794.4000000000001"," 4 plus 2 plus 1 that is 9."
"796.6800000000001"," Wait."
"797.68"," Let's clarify it."
"798.68"," Sum is this."
"799.68"," Then let's print the minimum value from the array."
"806.4799999999999"," So our minimum value is np dot min of a."
"812.3199999999999"," Now let's print the mean value."
"816.4799999999999"," So mean is np dot mean of a."
"821.3599999999999"," It's as simple as that."
"823.4"," Print median is np dot median of a."
"833.52"," Then print correlation coefficient is np dot correlation coefficient of a."
"847.96"," And finally the standard deviation."
"850.76"," Standard deviation is what?"
"852.36"," It's np dot s td of a."
"857.48"," Okay."
"858.48"," So let's execute it."
"863.6"," So we got the value as sum 7."
"867.48"," Minimum value is 1."
"868.48"," 1 to 4."
"869.48"," Correct."
"870.48"," Mean is 2.33."
"872.48"," That is 4 plus 2 plus 1."
"874.6800000000001"," That is 7 by 3."
"876.84"," 2.33 median is 2.0."
"879.92"," Correlation coefficient that is 1 and standard deviation is 1.24."
"883.92"," Okay."
"884.92"," So this was about the aggregate function."
"889.04"," Let's come back."
"890.36"," So next we have is np dot casting."
"893.68"," So let's see what exactly is."
"896.16"," For example, we have to array with different dimension."
"899.92"," Right."
"900.92"," But make sure the number of rows or number of columns are same."
"903.76"," Okay."
"904.76"," So in this case, what we have is same number of element in each array."
"908.12"," Okay."
"909.12"," So like when you add first array to the second array, what it does?"
"913.04"," It simply adds it."
"914.5600000000001"," Like, so here you can see we got as 0 plus 0 is 0 0 plus 1 is 1 0 plus 2 is 2."
"921.44"," But here again, 10 plus 0 is 10."
"924.96"," 10 plus 1 is 11."
"926.32"," 10 plus 2 is 12."
"928.12"," Similarly, what it did, it broadcasted this value and add all these value to different"
"933.92"," rows of this array."
"935.12"," Okay."
"936.12"," So same values being added to this row."
"938.2"," This row and this row."
"940.0"," Okay."
"941.0"," So this is the concept of dot casting as this particular array is broadcasted and summed"
"946.4000000000001"," with all the element of this particular array."
"949.2800000000001"," Let me just show you with an example."
"954.8000000000001"," This is concept of broadcasting."
"957.8000000000001"," Okay."
"958.8000000000001"," Let's import number as np."
"966.28"," Let's define a array as np dot array inside that."
"972.04"," Let's place few values 0 0 0."
"976.52"," Then 1 2 3."
"980.1999999999999"," Then 4 5 6."
"982.9599999999999"," Let's take one more."
"984.12"," Take it as 5 6 7."
"986.6"," Okay."
"987.6"," Now let's define another array b equal np dot array."
"992.8"," Then this let's specify a number like 0 1 and 2."
"997.7199999999999"," So this is the number which will be added to 0 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 5 6 7."
"1004.76"," And this is the concept of dot casting."
"1007.5999999999999"," Okay."
"1008.5999999999999"," Let me just show you print."
"1012.24"," First array."
"1013.8399999999999"," First array is what?"
"1016.84"," A. Right."
"1018.84"," Change the line."
"1021.84"," And then print the value of secondary."
"1026.8400000000001"," And then print the value of first array plus secondary."
"1034.8400000000001"," That is a plus b."
"1037.8400000000001"," Okay."
"1038.8400000000001"," Execute it."
"1039.8400000000001"," So here we got the output as first array is this."
"1041.8400000000001"," Secondary is this."
"1043.84"," And first array plus second array you can see that 0 1 2 is added to all these numbers."
"1050.84"," Fine."
"1051.84"," So this was the concept of broadcasting."
"1054.52"," And with this we come to the end of numpy array mathematics."
