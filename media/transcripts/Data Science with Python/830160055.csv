"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome all to the spythin certification course."
"8.36"," In our previous session we learned about numpy library in python and we also discussed about"
"12.8"," several functions from the numpy."
"15.0"," So now a question might arise in a mind like what is so special about numpy arrays?"
"20.16"," So why can't we use simple python list for these scientific computation?"
"24.04"," So let's move ahead and see what are the benefit of using numpy array over the list?"
"29.68"," So numpy array consumes less memory when compared to a list is also faster and more convenient"
"35.08"," as compared to a list."
"36.88"," Let me just take a few examples in my jippet and notebook and show you how exactly consumes"
"41.480000000000004"," less memory, how it is faster than a list and how it is more convenient than it."
"45.92"," Okay, so let's just get back to our jippet and notebook and advantages of numpy list."
"56.32"," So first let's compare numpy and list on the base of their memory size."
"61.92"," Numpy versus list parameter is memory size."
"65.88"," So for this let's import numpy as np and again import sys library."
"72.76"," Now let's define a list."
"76.72"," So let's say there's a list l equal range, so I arranged this fast 1000 numbers in it."
"84.16"," Okay."
"85.16"," Let's print the size of it."
"86.6"," So print sys dot get size of any integer between 1, 2000."
"93.08"," For example, I can take one over here size of any integer multiplied by how many total"
"97.92"," integers are over there?"
"98.92"," 1000, right?"
"99.92"," Either you can write 1000 or you can write length of L."
"104.08"," Okay."
"105.08"," Now I need to compare it with numpy array."
"107.0"," So let's define a numpy array."
"110.44"," So let's say a numpy array a equals np dot arrange 1000 numbers."
"119.44"," Okay."
"120.44"," Again, print a dot size multiplied by you can directly write 1000 over here or you can"
"127.6"," use a dot item size."
"130.04"," Okay."
"131.04"," Let's execute it."
"132.04"," Let's modify our code a bit here size of a list."
"139.92"," And here size of an array."
"145.44"," So we got the output as 28,000 as the size of the list and size of the array is 4000."
"152.0"," Okay."
"153.0"," So from here, I can say that storing a numpy array occupies less memory when compared to"
"158.76"," a list."
"159.76"," Okay."
"160.76"," Now that we have compared their memory size, now let's compare numpy and list on the"
"165.56"," basis of their speed."
"168.44"," So numpy versus list on the base of their speed for this, we have to import another package"
"179.6"," about time."
"182.24"," We have already imported numpy as np up there."
"185.44"," Now let's create a function."
"188.92"," Here I'm defining function as using list."
"193.92"," Just define our starting time, even equal time dot time."
"200.6"," Okay."
"201.6"," Now let's define a list x as x equal range of 1000 numbers."
"209.32"," And let's define another list by as range of 1000 numbers."
"215.67999999999998"," Let's say let's make them that."
"217.67999999999998"," Okay."
"219.51999999999998"," This way we can check the speed of their pressing in a better way."
"223.07999999999998"," Okay."
"223.84"," Let's add all the element of each list."
"226.16"," So z equal x of i plus y of i for i ranges in length of x or length of y or maybe 1000."
"243.72"," Okay."
"244.72"," Length of x of y anything where you can just write 1000 up here."
"249.04"," Okay."
"250.04"," So this is my z."
"251.56"," From this function what I want, return time dot time minus t1."
"259.56"," Now here this t1 was the initial time."
"264.24"," And now this time would be the process time."
"267.12"," That is time after executing this statement."
"270.28"," So if we subtract this time minus the initial time, we'll get the total time taken to process"
"275.44"," this particular line."
"276.8"," Now let's define another function."
"279.2"," So define using numpy same define the starting time."
"283.28"," Wait, let me just add some comments of here starting on the initial time."
"290.68"," This also the starting of the initial time."
"293.15999999999997"," Next let's define a numpy array now x equal np dot range of 1000 numbers."
"298.68"," Okay."
"299.68"," And b equal np dot."
"301.76"," I eat 10,000 numbers."
"304.56"," Now for the processing part what I want to do I want to take the sum of both a and b"
"309.32"," z equal just a plus p."
"312.16"," It's as simple as that."
"313.68"," And this is how it is more convenient than a list."
"320.36"," More convenient list."
"323.8"," Okay."
"324.8"," Now again what I want from here, return time dot time."
"331.08"," That is time after things are processed that is this particular statement is processed"
"336.32"," minus the initial time that is t1."
"339.8"," Okay."
"340.8"," Now let's call these to function and store the output and two variables."
"345.64"," Let's say list time equal using underscore list and numpy time equal using numpy."
"357.4"," Okay."
"358.4"," And finally let's print them print list underscore time number numpy underscore time."
"366.79999999999995"," And one more thing you can add up here is like in this example numpy is string value"
"379.2"," of list time divided by numpy underscore time."
"387.72"," That is the time taken to execute the numpy at this many times faster than a list."
"394.84000000000003"," Okay."
"395.84000000000003"," It's executed name using underscore list."
"399.96000000000004"," So for this example we got the processing time for list is 0.00199."
"407.36"," While for numpy we got 0.00099."
"412.56"," So in this example numpy is 1.99 times or almost 2x time faster than a list."
"419.24"," Okay."
"420.24"," So this is how a numpy is faster than a list."
"422.72"," And here I showed you how it is more convenient than a list."
"426.32"," So I hope these things are clear to you."
"428.44"," Coming back to our BPD let's see what we have ahead."
"431.44"," So we have already done this example numpy versus list memory size."
"436.16"," We also compare on the base of their speed."
"438.4"," And here I showed you how it is more convenient than a list."
