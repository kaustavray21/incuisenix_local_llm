"0.0"," Hello everyone in this session we are going to learn about the probability distributions"
"9.0"," which is very helpful concept when we are working for inferential statistics that will"
"13.0"," be covering in the next session."
"15.36"," So let's take a look at the agenda for this session."
"18.8"," So first of all we are going to start with what are probability distributions and then"
"22.48"," we are going to check what is a normal distribution."
"24.84"," After that we will cover various types of probability distributions and then we will"
"29.8"," cover probability mass function, probability density function and in the end we are going"
"33.84"," to sum up this session with central levity."
"37.88"," So without any further ado let's start probability distributions."
"42.08"," So what exactly is a probability distribution as you can see in the picture over here it"
"46.28"," is often depicted using graphs or tables or probability distribution is just a function"
"52.08"," that is going to portray the probability of different possible values of a feature or"
"55.84"," a variable."
"58.2"," What it means is that say we have a feature or a variable it has values in intervals or"
"63.96"," it could be any specific value the probability distribution will tell us what is the probability"
"69.24000000000001"," of a value in that particular distribution is going to be normally depicted using graphs."
"74.8"," Let's take a simple example to understand how we can use probability distributions."
"79.48"," So here we have the graph the frequency distribution of revenue for a company and here we can"
"87.2"," see the distribution is kind of in normal distribution like a bell curve that we will also"
"93.32000000000001"," cover later on in this session."
"96.44"," So what we can do here is let's assume that this is a normal frequency distribution and"
"101.4"," then we can create inferences based on some statistical evidence that normal distribution"
"106.72"," also go away. So we can assume characteristics of a normal distribution and create inferences"
"116.92"," like what is the standard deviation going to be how many values or how many percentage"
"120.56"," of values are going to fall within certain range based on our analysis."
"126.75999999999999"," So to understand how we can create those inferences let's take a look at what exactly is"
"132.44"," a normal distribution and how we can use it to create inferences."
"138.28"," Now a normal distribution or it is also called as Gaussian distribution have the frequency"
"143.92"," of the data distributed in a bell curve as we have already seen and the majority of the"
"148.28"," data is distributed in and around the central region as you can see over here."
"153.76"," The centroid or the central point of the normal distribution is going to be the mean and"
"158.04000000000002"," the data will be distributed below the mean and after the mean."
"163.04000000000002"," So that is how the data is distributed in a normal distribution."
"167.4"," So some of the properties of a normal distribution can be the mean, median and mode of a normal"
"172.20000000000002"," distributed sample is going to be always same."
"175.88"," For example, if let's say we have a distribution of 1000 employees salary and the mean is"
"183.32000000000002"," 20,000 for example, the median is going to be the same and the mode is always going to be the same"
"187.96"," for that distribution."
"189.32000000000002"," If there is any description in that they might be skewness in the data and that is how we can"
"195.56"," differentiate between a normal distribution and any other distribution."
"200.60000000000002"," Symmetry is always going to be present in the data where half of the data is less than the mean"
"205.16000000000003"," which I already said discussed and the other half is going to be greater which is on the left side"
"209.0"," or the right side of the graph."
"211.07999999999998"," And mean and standard deviation are two deciding parameters of the normal distribution curve."
"216.44"," The curve you see over here it is going to be thicker or leaner that depends on standard deviation"
"221.32"," on the mean itself. The other properties includes"
"225.72"," 99.7 percent values in the sample are three standard deviation away from the mean"
"231.88000000000002"," and 95 percent values are going to be two standard deviation away from the mean"
"237.4"," and 68 percent values in the sample are going to be one standard deviation away from the mean."
"243.4"," So as you can see over here the segments that are given the first two segments are going to be"
"248.20000000000002"," one standard deviation away then we include the other ones and then the other ones."
"252.20000000000002"," So that is what computes the 68 percent values the 95 percent values and the 99.7 percent values."
"259.96000000000004"," So these are some of the characteristics of a normal distribution."
"263.96000000000004"," Now there is another term called standard normal distribution which is the standardized version"
"268.76000000000005"," of normal distribution where the mean and standard deviation will have the value 0 and 1 respectively."
"277.0"," A standard normal distribution is also known as Z distribution. So let's say if we have a mean and"
"282.04"," or standard deviation as 0 and 1 we can say that the distribution is a standard normal distribution."
"288.12"," And it is basically a standard for all the normal distributions and it varies for peak and you know"
"294.20000000000005"," stretches in the curve and the median and standard deviations vary."
"298.04"," The mean will always going to be 0 and 1 for a standard normal distribution."
"303.48"," Moving further let's discuss Z score as well. So Z score measures how many standard deviation"
"310.92"," away the values are from the mean as we have discussed in a normal distribution. It can be given"
"316.44"," like we can generalize 68 percent values will be in the you know first one standard deviation away from"
"321.56"," the mean. But what if the distribution is not as normal distribution how do you calculate."
"329.88"," So how will you calculate the values or the interval basically how many standard deviations"
"335.24"," away your score lies. So that is where Z score comes into the picture and we can use Z score to"
"340.12"," calculate this. As you can see over here in the formula Z score is given by x minus sigma by x."
"346.36"," And the deviation which is Z score is associated with probability that is for sure where the P value for"
"352.52000000000004"," each Z score will tell us the likelihood of values below this Z score. And you know the P value of"
"359.8"," the critical and the P value can be calculated or can be you know, tallied from the Z distribution"
"368.12"," table where we can go and check the Z score whatever we have calculated and for the corresponding"
"373.96"," Z score we will get the P value as well. Now to understand Z score let's just take a simple example"
"379.71999999999997"," and we'll know how it erodes. So let's say for a sample we need to check the probability of a value"
"387.0"," being less than 1150. But to get the Z score you also need to know the mean and standard deviation."
"395.56"," So the sample mean over here is given by 1000 and standard deviation is just 100. So we'll put that"
"400.84"," into the formula and we will have 1150 minus 1000 that is 150 by 100 which is 1.5."
"410.52"," So for the corresponding Z score that is 1.5 the P value in the Z distribution table is 0.93."
"417.15999999999997"," So we know for sure that the probability of value being less than 1150 is going to be 93%."
"426.04"," So that is how Z score can be used in normal distribution or any other distributions where we know"
"432.84"," the standard deviation and mean of the sample and we can get the probability of or how much or how"
"438.52"," many values are going to be within a specific range. Now that we are done with the Z score let's also"
"444.76"," take a look at some of the types of probability distributions. So as you can see over here we have"
"451.08"," two types of probability distributions. First one is discrete probability distribution"
"456.76"," and our discrete probability distribution is for categorical or discrete variables."
"462.12"," Now if you remember or you recall in the first session itself we had discussed types of data"
"470.2"," in that we had discussed categorical discrete, ordinal and continuous variables and that is"
"475.8"," exactly what we are referring to here and for discrete probability distribution it uses"
"483.48"," probability mass function to describe the discrete probability distribution. So that is one of the"
"490.04"," you know one of the other differences between both of these probability distributions or continuous"
"495.72"," probability distribution it is only used for continuous variables and it uses the probability density"
"503.24"," to describe the continuous probability distribution. Now we have two different terms over the new"
"508.04"," terms over here which are probability mass function and probability density function. So let's go"
"514.6"," ahead and talk about these two. So first of all we will discuss probability mass function to understand"
"521.88"," probability mass function. We are going to take a simple example where a fair coin is going to be"
"526.36"," tossed twice. The number of time it is going to be tossed is twice and let's say the x is the number"
"532.12"," of heads that we observe and we want to find the probability mass function of P of x."
"539.24"," So when we are using probability mass function, probability of x of number of times k is given by"
"546.28"," P of x is equal to k where k is the rx which we have mentioned over here and it is nothing but the"
"552.92"," range of random variable. So in our case the sample space we have if we are tossing the coin"
"560.44"," twice we have heads heads, tail heads, heads and tails and both our tails. So these are the four"
"567.64"," possible values that we get. Now the range of random variables for our event is if we get a head"
"573.08"," or not. So first event would be we are getting no heads so that is zero then we can get a one head"
"579.5600000000001"," in our sample space and then we have another one which is two heads. So zero one and two for our"
"585.24"," of x. Now the probability of the probability mass function will calculate the probability for"
"592.1999999999999"," each of these events. Now the solution would be when the number of times it is zero the number of"
"598.1999999999999"," heads this is one by four and if we have one number of heads then we have one by two. If we have"
"606.1999999999999"," two heads that is also one by four. So that is the probability distribution using the probability"
"612.04"," mass function. So this is a very simple example. Now let us go ahead and discuss the types of"
"617.4"," you know distribution that come under or basically discrete probability distribution that we"
"623.0"," calculated using probability mass function. So the first one that we have is binomial probability"
"628.76"," distribution. All right so a binomial distribution summarizes the likelihood of a variable that"
"636.76"," will be having one of the two independent outcomes. So another thing a binomial distribution is"
"643.24"," obtained obtained by performing binomial trials. So binomial trials will have characteristics like"
"649.56"," there are only going to be two possible outcomes as you as we have an example that we have just"
"654.28"," discussed tossing a coin will only have two outcomes either a head or a tail. So that is there"
"660.84"," and each outcome has a fixed probability of occurring. So if I toss a coin once the probability of"
"667.96"," getting a head is one by two the probability of getting a tail is one by two itself."
"673.16"," All right and each trial is independent of the other. So that is always there. If I am tossing"
"679.24"," the coin twice tries four times every time the trial is independent of each other we do not know."
"686.3599999999999"," Or basically we know what the probability of an outcome is but we are not certain enough."
"692.04"," So let us let us understand binomial probability distribution using a simple example."
"697.8"," So let us understand this by implementing example using python programming where a discrete random"
"704.52"," variable will only have two outcomes. Now in this random experiment where a bias coin is"
"712.0400000000001"," 10 times if the probability of getting a head is 0.4 in all these trials we have to find the"
"718.5200000000001"," binomial probability distribution of the entire event. So to do that we are going to use python"
"723.48"," programming. So in this we have a scipy module in python where we can use this binomial function"
"731.0"," in the stats module. So the key or the main important things that we have to consider here is"
"739.4000000000001"," the number of trials that is 10 that we already know and the probability of the event of getting a head"
"745.8000000000001"," is 0.4 and obviously if the probability of getting a head is 0.4 the probability of getting a tail"
"752.9200000000001"," will automatically become 0.6 and then we are taking the sample space basically where we have"
"759.4000000000001"," the number of favorable outcomes. So we can if you are doing 10 times the coin toss we can get"
"766.52"," 1 times 0 time 2 time and so on. So that is why we are taking a list of range and mean and variance"
"772.52"," we are calculating. After that we are just creating a distribution using this binomial function and"
"778.4399999999999"," if you see over there there is a PMF function which is nothing but the probability mass function"
"782.8399999999999"," that python provides and here we are calculating probability for each of the outcome."
"788.68"," Then when we plot it as you can see it is kind of forming a bell curve but"
"793.0"," you can see for each outcome what is the probability for 0 it is closer to 0 and then it is the"
"800.92"," highest for getting 4 number of heads in the you know in a trial. So the highest probability is"
"808.92"," getting heads 4 times and then it curves down towards 0 again for when it reaches 10 the"
"817.32"," probability is less than 0 times. So probability of getting tails for all the outcomes is more"
"825.24"," than probability of getting heads because we already know that probability of getting a"
"829.4000000000001"," h is 0.4 in those number of trials and that is how you implement a simple binomial probability"
"836.2"," distribution using python programming. Now moving ahead let us discuss a Poisson probability"
"843.4000000000001"," distribution as well. So a Poisson distribution is nothing but a discrete distribution."
"849.96"," Now what we have done is we have taken binomial distribution which is this can we can say it was"
"855.72"," a categorical data we had only two outcomes. Now for a discrete distribution we will create"
"862.9200000000001"," estimates or basically you know calculate the likelihood of an event in a given time duration."
"870.1999999999999"," Alright so we will have intervals in a Poisson distribution not specifically just values like"
"876.28"," how we had a sample space where each outcome was there in the binomial distribution. Here we are"
"881.16"," going to have intervals or time duration. So it is given by this formula as you can see over here"
"887.56"," where lambda is a mean number of successes that occurred during a specific interval k is the number"
"892.6800000000001"," of successes and a is basically a constant as equal to approximately 2.71828. Now you don't have to"
"901.5600000000001"," worry about this formula per se because we already have python programming modules that will work"
"907.8000000000001"," for us. You just have to understand how you can create a Poisson probability distribution and what"
"912.52"," kind of data it supports. So let us again take a little example to understand this. So we are"
"919.32"," again going to implement this using python programming. So let us just suppose what is the"
"923.88"," probability of number of schools in the range 0 to 5 where the mean number of schools in a 10"
"931.96"," kilometer radius is 3. So we already know the 10 kilometer radius is going to be our interval over"
"940.0400000000001"," here which is going to be time duration as well for some of the examples but here it is just an"
"944.68"," interval 10 kilometer and we already know the mean values for that. And we are going to calculate"
"953.4799999999999"," the probability of how many number of schools can be present from 0 to 5 over there. So using python"
"959.3199999999999"," programming which is going to plot the python probability distribution. So we are going to use"
"964.1999999999999"," again a scipy module where we have a stats module and inside that we have a Poisson function."
"969.3199999999999"," So using that Poisson distribution we have the number of the samples basically 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5."
"977.2399999999999"," How many schools are going to be present? And yeah the probability of that is presented away"
"983.56"," using plot. So 0 schools having you know since the mean is 3 the probability of having a 0"
"990.92"," school in that radius is going to be very low. And then again since we had a mean 3 the highest"
"995.88"," probability of a school in that region is 3 and then 4 and 5 again it reduces."
"1002.76"," So that is a very simple example of using python programming for Poisson distribution or Poisson"
"1008.1999999999999"," probability distribution. Now moving ahead let's discuss the probability density function."
"1015.56"," Now probability mass function was for discrete random discrete variables. For continuous variables"
"1022.0400000000001"," we use probability density function to create the probability distribution."
"1026.8400000000001"," So probability density function on the other hand is used to calculate the probability"
"1030.68"," distribution on continuous random variables that I already told you. And we have given over here"
"1036.3600000000001"," the density function for a normal distribution which is given my f of x is equal to 1 by this entire"
"1043.72"," so the probability of probability density function of a normal distribution is given by this formula"
"1048.84"," where x is the value of the variable or dot data that is being examined."
"1053.0"," And then we have the mean and standard deviation. So we already know let's say if there is a"
"1058.04"," standard normal distribution we already know that mean and standard deviation is going to be 0 and 1."
"1063.48"," All right so let's just see how we"
"1067.56"," we can plot this Gaussian property distribution using python programming."
"1072.84"," So Gaussian probability distribution or normal distribution is based on sample mean and standard"
"1077.8"," deviation that we already know with the probability density function calculates the likelihood"
"1082.36"," of a point in the distribution because we cannot have categories or intervals here like we had in"
"1087.24"," a binomial or Poisson distribution. Here we have continuous values so for each point in that data"
"1092.68"," we are going to calculate the probability and that is how the distribution will be calculated."
"1098.52"," So this is the function that we can use. And here again we have the mean, standard deviation and"
"1104.84"," the input value. Also again we don't have to worry about this because python already has"
"1111.32"," the density function that we use to calculate the distribution. Now again we are going to take a"
"1116.84"," simple example to create a probability distribution for a sample that has 1000 random variables."
"1122.36"," We know the mean and standard deviation now we will calculate the distribution table."
"1127.48"," All right so to calculate the normal distribution we again have this statistics model from"
"1132.44"," scipy where we have the normalization or the normal distribution function as well."
"1137.8"," So we have the mean, the standard deviation we have created a random sample within the range"
"1142.28"," minus 100 200 which has 1000 values. So that is our sample and we are creating."
"1150.2"," So we have this normal distribution and then again we are getting the"
"1156.1200000000001"," probability distribution using the PDF probability density function for the sample."
"1160.76"," And when we plot this we are getting this belko which is nothing but normal distribution or any"
"1168.3600000000001"," Gaussian probability distribution would look like here. The mean will have equal number of values"
"1174.92"," or you know the probabilities on the left hand side on the right hand side which we less than mean"
"1179.88"," and more than mean and that is how you can plot the Gaussian probability distribution."
"1185.72"," And we can also assume the same properties that we have first 100 normal distribution you know"
"1190.2"," a 68% of values of being on one standard deviation away from the mean and so on."
"1197.0"," So that is all about the probability distributions. Now let's go ahead and understand"
"1202.1200000000001"," standard central limit theorem. So a central limit theorem states that if we take several random"
"1208.76"," samples from a population that has a finite variance the mean of the samples will form a normal"
"1215.56"," distribution. Now this is a little trick here we are taking let's say we have a population which"
"1221.48"," has 10,000 observations. Now we are taking 1000 sample samples. Let's say we are taking 20 samples"
"1230.12"," or 50 samples from that particular population being 1000 observations each."
"1236.36"," The mean of those 1000 observations for each of the sample if we plot them on a graph it will"
"1242.12"," create a normal distribution that is what the central limit theorem says. So there are a few"
"1248.4399999999998"," limitations or we can say assumptions that we have today. So the sample should not exceed 10%"
"1253.7199999999998"," of the population. So let's say the population has 1000 observations the samples will only have 100"
"1261.8799999999999"," or less than 100. And sample itself or the population might not be normally distributed."
"1268.28"," So that is also there it does not necessarily mean that your population is already normally"
"1273.24"," distributed and then the mean of the samples will be distributed when we calculate the sample means."
"1279.48"," That is also not there. Now to understand this the central limit theorem you can plot the same"
"1284.92"," for a random sample. So here what we have done is taken sample means for each of the sample like we"
"1295.08"," have created almost 1000 samples where we are taking values from minus 10 to 10 and 100 observations."
"1306.6799999999998"," And when we plot these sample means basically we are getting a normal distribution that is close"
"1314.84"," to a normal distribution. So we can assume it is a normal distribution and according to central"
"1318.6799999999998"," limit theorem it is always going to be a normal distribution when we calculate the sample means for"
"1324.12"," all these it is always going to be a normal distribution for the samples. And with this we have"
"1331.56"," come to the end of the session guys and in the upcoming session we are going to discuss inferential"
"1338.04"," statistics that is also one of the very important parts of statistical analysis or data analytics"
"1343.9599999999998"," engine will because they we have population samples and on a lot of statistical tests that help us"
"1349.88"," so create inferences and conclusions basically provide actionable insights for the same."
"1356.68"," So more on that in the next session thank you."
