"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome back to Python certification course."
"8.16"," In our previous session we saw how to create and customize scatterplot."
"13.76"," So our today's session is on how to create a histogram."
"16.8"," In this session you will learn about how to create a histogram and how you can customize"
"22.2"," it."
"23.2"," So without delaying any further let's quickly jump back to our jiffyrenode book and"
"26.68"," see how you can create a histogram using matplotlib."
"29.88"," Okay, so there's the jiffyrenode book where we left."
"33.28"," So here I'll be creating a histogram."
"35.28"," Well this histogram is generally used to display a frequency across a continuous or"
"39.480000000000004"," a discrete variable."
"40.480000000000004"," Okay, let's see how to create it."
"43.28"," How to create histogram."
"47.6"," So the very first thing that I'll be doing up here is importing my matplotlib library."
"52.76"," So import matplotlib.pyplot as plt."
"58.28"," This will help me to visualize my data and then percentage matplotlib inline for rendering"
"65.92"," the figure in the notebook."
"67.32"," Next let's prepare our dataset."
"69.32"," So preparing the dataset."
"73.52"," Let's define some numbers."
"76.6"," Let's say I want to add five numbers between 10 to 20."
"79.36"," So let's add 10, 12, 16, 19 and 11."
"84.96"," Then then two numbers between 20 to 30."
"88.19999999999999"," So 20, 26 and 28."
"91.19999999999999"," Let's say three numbers."
"92.28"," Then let's add four numbers between 30 to 40."
"95.44"," So 30, 45, 30, 38, 35, 34."
"100.36"," Now let's add few numbers between 60 to 70."
"103.48"," So 60, 68, 64, 62."
"106.92"," Now let's add some numbers between 70 to 90."
"110.36"," So 70, 78, 75, 79, 85, 94 and 95 enough."
"118.16"," Now let's create a histogram."
"122.4"," Let's see creating the histogram."
"125.2"," Now for creating the histogram, what we'll do will just call plt.hist and inside that"
"130.8"," will pass the number and we'll define the bins."
"134.08"," Well this bin is a range of values that divide the entire range of values into a series"
"138.56"," of intervals and then count how many values fall in each interval."
"142.88000000000002"," It's like if we are defining the range as 10 to 20."
"146.12"," So how many numbers fall between the range of 10 to 20?"
"149.24"," Okay."
"150.24"," So let's define the bin as bin equal zero, zero, 20, 40, 16, 80 and 100."
"157.96"," It depends on you."
"158.96"," So let's define any kind of bins up here."
"160.88"," Now let's check out plot."
"162.52"," So plt.show."
"164.6"," So the hizard required graph."
"166.12"," We don't have any number between 42 to 60."
"169.32"," No numbers between 42 to 60."
"171.16"," That's why we didn't got any bar up here."
"173.48000000000002"," If you just add one of the number between 45, now let's see, we'll get this output."
"180.04000000000002"," So on your x axis is the range of the numbers and on your y axis is the frequency of the"
"185.08"," numbers falling into that particular range."
"187.76"," Now let's just move ahead and customize our histogram."
"193.28"," Customizing the histogram."
"196.35999999999999"," So now the very first thing that I'll do is add a title up here."
"200.2"," So plt.title."
"201.44"," Histogram demo."
"202.84"," Nail art plt.x label as range of values."
"211.6"," Plt.y label is frequency of just frequency of values."
"220.6"," Executed."
"221.6"," We got this."
"222.6"," So now talking about these bars."
"224.2"," So you can change the color of these bar by adding hex color codes to them."
"228.07999999999998"," Let me show you how."
"229.07999999999998"," So this was my pen."
"231.0"," So let's define color as let's choose a hex value."
"235.48"," 5, 2, 3, 3, 1."
"237.88"," Six values."
"238.88"," 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6."
"240.64"," So this hex value represents a color."
"243.11999999999998"," Let's see which color is that."
"244.55999999999997"," So it's this."
"245.55999999999997"," So you can even define a edge color to your graph."
"248.11999999999998"," Like edge color equal."
"250.72"," Let's say."
"251.72"," So as you can see, we have added white as a edge color over here."
"254.95999999999998"," Right."
"255.95999999999998"," You can even change it to black."
"257.8"," Any color you want."
"259.08"," Now let's see what else we can do."
"261.32"," So we can also add grid to it."
"263.84"," So plt.red make it true."
"266.4"," If you want, you can save your file."
"268.32"," So plt.save the figure as let's say histogram plot dot png."
"277.0"," These are the various ways we can customize a histogram plot."
"279.91999999999996"," So this was all about the histogram plot."
"281.96"," In our next session, we'll see how to create a box plot and a violent plot."
