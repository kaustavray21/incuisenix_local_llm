"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome back to our Python certification course."
"9.24"," Today in this session we'll learn about the most popular Python library that is NumPy."
"13.96"," So in this session I'll be telling you what exactly is NumPy and how you can use your"
"18.2"," Jupyter notebook to create a basic NumPy array."
"21.88"," So let's start with what exactly is NumPy?"
"26.44"," So what is NumPy?"
"27.720000000000002"," Well, a NumPy is a most widely used Python library for linear algebra."
"32.36"," It is used for performing mathematical and logical operations on multi-dimensional array."
"37.760000000000005"," NumPy consists of various set of functions that can be used while performing your mathematical"
"41.92"," and logical operations."
"43.480000000000004"," So this was about what exactly it is."
"46.400000000000006"," Now the question arises, how to create a NumPy array?"
"49.760000000000005"," Well, we have shown some basic example up here, how to create a NumPy array."
"55.24"," So we have created 1D array up here and 2D array."
"59.32"," Let me show you this example in my Jupyter notebook."
"61.64"," This would make things more easier for you to understand."
"64.92"," So this is my Jupyter notebook."
"70.68"," So the very first thing that I'll do up here is define my one dimensional array."
"79.96000000000001"," So how to define a 1D array?"
"82.4"," So for that, the very first thing that I have to do is import my NumPy library."
"87.68"," So I'll be importing NumPy as NP."
"91.08000000000001"," Why I'm using NP up here?"
"92.72"," So it's just because whenever I want to call some function of NumPy, I don't want to use"
"97.30000000000001"," NumPy every time."
"99.2"," So apart from it, what I can do, I can just replace the word NumPy and NP."
"104.84"," So once you have imported NumPy as NP, let's define an array as a equal NP dot array."
"114.04"," So here instead of writing NumPy dot array, I can just go ahead and write NP dot array."
"119.52000000000001"," That's it."
"121.04"," And inside the array, we'll pass list of arrays."
"124.96000000000001"," Okay?"
"125.96000000000001"," Like 1, 2, 3."
"127.80000000000001"," Okay?"
"128.8"," And print A."
"131.68"," So this is how my 1D array looks like."
"134.48"," Now let me show you how you can create a 2D array."
"137.84"," So let's create a 2 dimensional array."
"143.32"," Again, let's import NumPy as NP."
"151.39999999999998"," Let's define an array as V equal NP dot array."
"158.04"," Inside array, what do we pass?"
"160.35999999999999"," List of function, right?"
"162.2"," So let's pass 1, 2, 3, comma 4, 5, 6 and print B."
"173.35999999999999"," I'm telling you this with generator error."
"175.83999999999997"," Just think why?"
"179.2"," It gave your error of data type not understood, right?"
"183.2"," So why do you think you are getting up this error?"
"186.12"," Any guesses anyone?"
"187.83999999999997"," Think."
"188.84"," Remember what I set up here?"
"191.04"," What do you pass an array?"
"192.92000000000002"," List of array, right?"
"194.28"," So where is array up here?"
"196.8"," It's a list, right?"
"197.8"," But we have to pass a list of array, right?"
"201.72"," So we'll enclose everything in, opening and closing square brackets."
"206.56"," So this will dissolve your error."
"208.08"," Okay?"
"209.08"," So this is how you've got the final output as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6."
"213.4"," So this is how you create your 2 dimensional array using NumPy, okay?"
