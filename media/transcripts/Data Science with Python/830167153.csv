"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome back to Python certification course."
"8.06"," In our previous session we learned about how to create a pie chart and a donor chart."
"12.38"," I hope those things are clear to you."
"14.5"," In our today's session we'll see how to create an area chart."
"17.78"," Well you can say that an area chart is basically the modified version of the line chart."
"23.86"," The only difference between a line chart and an area chart is that the space between a"
"28.42"," line chart and the axis is filled in case of area chart."
"33.1"," That's it."
"34.1"," Okay."
"35.1"," So in this session we'll see how to create an area chart and how to merge a line chart"
"39.980000000000004"," and an area chart."
"41.34"," Okay."
"42.34"," So without delaying any further let's quickly jump back to a Jupyter notebook and see"
"46.06"," how to create the area plot."
"48.06"," So this is our Jupyter notebook."
"50.74"," So how to create a area chart."
"56.94"," So the very first thing that I'll be doing up here is importing my library."
"60.059999999999995"," So let's import map.lib."
"63.94"," Dot."
"64.94"," Pie plot."
"65.94"," Has PLT."
"66.94"," Okay."
"67.94"," Next let's align our visualization with our cell."
"70.74"," So for that we have percentage map plot."
"74.58"," Lib."
"75.58"," Inline."
"76.58"," Okay."
"77.58"," Now let's define our data set."
"79.82"," Find the data set."
"81.78"," So here I have X as a range of number between 1 to 15."
"86.02"," I have defined y as 14684532415 and so on."
"91.25999999999999"," Okay."
"92.25999999999999"," Now let's create the area plot out of it."
"94.5"," So creating the area plot."
"99.42"," So for creating the area plot we have to call PLT.stackplot and inside that just pass X and Y."
"108.34"," That's it."
"109.34"," And finally let's see our visualization."
"111.62"," So PLT.show executed."
"114.34"," So this is my area chart."
"116.26"," Now if you want you can even customize it by adding colors and setting, transparencies"
"120.62"," and all."
"121.62"," Let me just show you how."
"122.82000000000001"," So let's define a parameter."
"124.58"," Color is equal."
"125.58"," Let's say I want black in it and let's set the opacity or the alpha value to 0.5."
"134.1"," Okay."
"135.1"," So I got visualization something like this."
"137.94"," Okay."
"138.94"," So this is my area chart."
"140.78"," Now my next task is to merge the area chart with the line chart."
"146.7"," Merge area chart with the line chart."
"152.98"," So for this you don't have to do much works."
"155.18"," Just write PLT.plot and create a line chart using the same values of X and Y."
"161.86"," So X, Y and let's set the color to let's say green without any alpha value."
"167.7"," Okay."
"168.7"," Let's see."
"169.7"," So here you can see we got our visualization in which both the area charts and the line chart"
"174.94"," is merged together."
"175.94"," If you want you can even add the grid over here."
"178.06"," So PLT dot grid inside this right true."
"185.17999999999998"," So here we have a combination of area chart with the line chart."
"189.42"," So this was all about the area chart."
