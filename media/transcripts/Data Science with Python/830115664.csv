"0.0"," So in this session we'll learn about file handling and we'll see how you can read and write"
"9.44"," to your files using Python."
"13.6"," So coming to our last topic of file handling in Python, well file handling is a very important"
"19.0"," of any web application."
"20.400000000000002"," Well, you have four different features which you can perform in a file handling."
"24.36"," You can open read, write and delete a file using Python."
"28.0"," Alright, let's see them one by one."
"30.8"," The first one being open."
"35.36"," So you can use open function to open a file and it takes two parameters, the file name"
"40.16"," and the mode."
"41.64"," Let's see the syntax."
"44.2"," Centax is F equal open path of the file."
"48.36"," So you have the syntax as F equal open path of the file and its mode."
"53.04"," Fine, let's see what are the modes."
"58.72"," So we have four different types of mode."
"61.0"," Read, append, write and create for reading your specify R."
"65.0"," It's a default value and it opens the file for reading and the file does not exist."
"69.76"," It would return you an error."
"71.6"," Next is the append and the mode is A."
"75.36"," Alright, what it will do?"
"77.03999999999999"," It will open a file for upending and in case of the file does not exist, it would create"
"81.32"," a new one."
"84.24"," Next mode is W, which is write."
"89.16"," It opens a file for writing and creates a file if it does not exist."
"93.16"," Fine, I'll tell you about the difference of upending and writing later in this section."
"98.56"," Alright, next and the final one is create, that is X."
"103.88"," It creates the specified file and it returns an error if the file with the same name exists."
"109.47999999999999"," It creates the specified file and it returns an error if you already have a file"
"114.16"," with same name."
"116.08"," Fine, let me just show you."
"121.6"," Like F equal open, path of the file, I'll open it in my D drive, D slash, name of the"
"132.24"," file, test file dot TXT and comma."
"141.8"," What should be my mode?"
"143.84"," It has a reading mode."
"146.08"," R, hit enter."
"150.84"," Okay."
"157.2"," So as I told you earlier, it would throw you an error if the file does not exist."
"162.08"," Right?"
"163.8"," If you want to create it, you have to mention X up here and it will create your file."
"170.28"," Let's go to a D directory and let me just show you the file."
"174.28"," D, so you can see the test file up here."
"177.48"," Right?"
"178.48"," So this is how you can open a file in Python or you can even write W up here."
"186.56"," It won't throw you an error."
"190.88"," Since it creates a file, if it does not exist, but it won't throw you an error in case the"
"195.72"," file with same name exists."
"199.44"," This is the read function."
"202.04"," Well, suppose there's a file."
"205.52"," It consists of document hello, welcome to demo file dot TXT."
"209.2"," This file is for testing purpose."
"210.84"," Good luck."
"211.84"," Let's open our demo file."
"215.52"," Test file."
"217.52"," Hello, everyone."
"222.04"," Welcome."
"227.92"," To entirely bad."
"231.92"," Good luck."
"235.92"," Save it."
"239.92"," Save it as test file dot 1."
"244.92"," Fine."
"245.92"," Let's see what the operation we can perform on it."
"249.92"," Now, what if I want to read it?"
"251.64"," So how will I do?"
"252.96"," So F equal open demo file dot TXT comma mode R is what reading mode and then print F dot"
"260.24"," read."
"261.24"," Fine."
"262.24"," Let me just open that file for you."
"266.48"," F equal open."
"269.28000000000003"," The path of the file it was decolon slash test file 1 dot TXT."
"282.84"," And in what mode I want to open it in read mode."
"287.28"," And I want to print all the content which is present in that particular text file."
"293.03999999999996"," So F dot read it first and then print it."
"298.03999999999996"," Hit and talk."
"299.03999999999996"," So these are the content of my file."
"300.64"," Hello, everyone."
"301.64"," Welcome to entirely bad and good luck."
"305.03999999999996"," Fine."
"307.03999999999996"," Now what if I want to read some parts of the file?"
"310.84"," Like I want to read the first five characters of the file."
"313.64"," So what will I do?"
"315.4"," Let's see."
"316.4"," Let me just copy and paste it."
"320.64"," I want to read the first five characters."
"322.47999999999996"," So just mention five up here."
"325.03999999999996"," What will it do?"
"328.44"," Print first five characters from the text file."
"339.48"," Get into."
"341.08000000000004"," So you got the output as hello 01234 and file."
"344.48"," So these are the first five characters from the string."
"347.40000000000003"," All right."
"348.40000000000003"," Fine."
"349.40000000000003"," Now what if you want to read the first line?"
"354.04"," So for that you have a function as read line."
"357.08000000000004"," All right."
"358.08000000000004"," You have function as read line which would be used to return one line or the first line."
"364.44"," Again, copy it."
"368.76"," Paste it up here."
"370.2"," Read."
"371.2"," Read line."
"373.2"," Just hit and talk."
"376.0"," Sorry."
"377.0"," You got an error."
"378.2"," Okay."
"379.2"," I wrote a little bit of the read line."
"380.68"," Okay."
"381.68"," Sorry."
"382.68"," L is small."
"383.68"," Read line."
"385.48"," So you got the output as hello everyone."
"387.76"," This is my first line."
"392.4"," What if I need to read first to line of my document?"
"395.64"," So what will I do in that case?"
"397.4"," So in that case what you can do you can use read line twice and it will print first to"
"403.52"," line of your text."
"406.08"," Like this again do it once more f dot read line."
"413.32"," Hit enter."
"416.32"," In the same manner."
"417.79999999999995"," Okay."
"418.79999999999995"," So what you got?"
"420.32"," So you got the first line from your text."
"423.32"," All right."
"427.24"," Now looping through the file."
"429.84"," Now what if you want to read the file line by line?"
"432.4"," So you can use a for loop in that case."
"438.4"," So it's like for x n f such that print x."
"450.47999999999996"," If x is 1 then print first line x is 2 then print second line 3 so on."
"457.03999999999996"," All right."
"458.28"," So you will be able to read the file line by line."
"461.12"," Hello everyone."
"462.12"," Welcome to IntelliPart and good luck."
"470.15999999999997"," Next is reading and creating."
"472.68"," Now to write to an existing file you must add a parameter to the open function."
"477.08"," Like you can write a or w a will append the file that it will append or add something"
"483.56"," at the end of the file and w it will overwrite any other existing content."
"489.68"," For example."
"490.68"," Let's copy these data here instead of our let's mention a is for pending and."
"503.56"," f dot write whatever you want to write."
"510.24"," This is the appending statement."
"517.48"," Execute it."
"519.28"," Fine."
"522.36"," Now if you will check the file."
"525.88"," Just check the existing file."
"530.32"," Let an a real line mode are for x and f print x executed."
"543.9200000000001"," So as you can see this is the appending statement got added at the end of the file."
"550.5600000000001"," Now what if I use w instead of a."
"560.32"," So what will it do this will."
"570.32"," Overwrite my statements."
"579.8"," So here I can write print f dot write print f dot write this will overwrite everything."
"603.4399999999999"," Execute it."
"605.92"," Done."
"606.92"," Now let's check it again."
"608.68"," What are the contents of my file."
"613.92"," So if you check it."
"619.76"," So only this is left."
"622.68"," This will overwrite everything."
"625.0"," Fine."
"626.0"," So this was about how you can write an existing file."
"634.24"," Next we have is creating a new file."
"641.36"," Well you can create it using x a or w using x creates a file and it returns an error if"
"647.72"," the file exists up and it creates a file if the specified file does not exist."
"655.04"," And finally w it creates the file if the specified file does not exist."
"662.16"," For example f open my file or txt x it will just create a new file."
"668.56"," And in case you are attempting to create a file with the same name it will throw you"
"672.0799999999999"," an error."
"674.7199999999999"," For example."
"676.3199999999999"," Remove this."
"685.56"," This file already exists right."
"687.24"," If I am trying to create it again it will throw me an error."
"691.24"," Alright."
"694.16"," As file already exists or file exists."
"698.6"," Fine."
"701.52"," Next in the last we have is the delete."
"703.4"," Well import OS module is used to delete a file."
"707.2"," How you can delete it."
"708.96"," Import the OS module OS.remove demofile.txt."
"712.8"," That's it."
"715.04"," But for that what you have to do you have to first close the open file."
"721.36"," So f dot close inside this mention the name of the file."
"726.04"," At the path of the file decolon slash test file 1 dot txt."
"734.64"," First close it."
"741.64"," Sorry."
"758.64"," It's like f dot close close the file."
"765.16"," Now if you want to delete it you need to import OS module to it import OS and OS dot remove"
"779.76"," inside that name of the file."
"781.76"," What is the name of the file?"
"785.24"," Next file 1 dot txt."
"789.72"," That's it."
"790.72"," For the error the system cannot find the specified file."
"796.88"," So I guess the file is."
"798.6"," No it's not deleted."
"802.08"," Okay."
"803.08"," I haven't specified the path of the file."
"805.5600000000001"," I just written the name of it."
"806.92"," So I'll write decolon slash and the file got deleted."
"812.36"," There is no test file 1."
"815.36"," All right."
"816.36"," Fine."
"817.36"," So thank you guys."
"818.36"," This was all for this session."
