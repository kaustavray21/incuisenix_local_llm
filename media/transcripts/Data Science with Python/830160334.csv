"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome back to Python certification course."
"8.72"," Till now we have learned about NumPy."
"12.040000000000001"," I hope everything is clear to you guys."
"14.8"," So moving on ahead, our today's session will be on Introduction to SciPy."
"19.36"," So in this session, we'll learn about what exactly is a SciPy, what are its various"
"24.240000000000002"," character sticks and what are the various sub packages available in SciPy."
"28.72"," I hope the agenda is clear to you guys."
"31.599999999999998"," So without delaying any further, let's start with what is SciPy?"
"36.0"," Well, SciPy is a free and open source Python library which is used for scientific and"
"40.4"," technical computing."
"42.8"," It contains module for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special"
"48.04"," functions, Fourier transformation, signal and image processing and other scientific"
"53.32"," computations which are most common in science and engineering."
"57.52"," This library is built upon NumPy to make the scientific calculation more efficient."
"62.120000000000005"," But before we actually move ahead, there's few special characteristics of SciPy that you"
"66.56"," should be familiar with."
"68.32000000000001"," So let's move ahead and discuss about some of the characteristics of SciPy."
"73.28"," So first of all, it contains toolboxes dedicated to common shoes in scientific computing."
"78.48"," Secondly, SciPy offers different sub modules for different applications."
"83.68"," Third is, it operates very efficiently on NumPy."
"86.92"," We can say NumPy and SciPy works hand in hand."
"90.64"," Okay."
"91.64"," So fourth is, it adds significant power to the interactive Python session by providing"
"95.32000000000001"," the user with high level commands and classes for manipulating and visualizing the data."
"100.64"," Finally, SciPy routines are tested and optimized."
"104.04"," Therefore, SciPy should be used whenever possible."
"107.04"," Non-programmer scientists face difficulties while performing scientific calculations in large"
"112.48"," real-world data."
"113.88"," So this issue can be resolved very efficiently with the help of short and simple codes offered"
"118.52"," by SciPy."
"119.52"," So, this was about some of the characteristics of SciPy."
"122.84"," So it allows we know what exactly is a SciPy and what are its various characteristics."
"127.28"," Right?"
"128.28"," So let's just move ahead and see what are the various sub packages or sub-modules that"
"132.35999999999999"," this library has to offer."
"134.07999999999998"," Okay."
"135.07999999999998"," So these are the various sub packages which are a part of SciPy."
"139.12"," So first of all, we have something called SciPy.clusters, which comes in handy while dealing"
"143.48"," with vector-cointurization or k-means clustering."
"146.76"," Second, we have is SciPy.start, which is generally used for statistics."
"151.83999999999997"," Then come SciPy.optimize, which is used for minimizing or maximizing objective functions."
"157.51999999999998"," Another very important sub package is SciPy.integrate."
"160.95999999999998"," This is useful while dealing with different integration routines."
"164.44"," Then we have SciPy.linealgy, which is generally used to perform linear algebra routines."
"170.36"," And finally, we have SciPy.fft pack, which is used for fast Fourier transform."
"174.84"," Okay."
"175.84"," So these are the various sub packages which are available under SciPy."
"178.68"," So in our next session, we'll deal with them one by one in detail."
"182.68"," Okay."
