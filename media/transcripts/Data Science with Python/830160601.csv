"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome back to Python certification course."
"8.74"," In our previous session, I gave you a brief introduction to scipy."
"12.84"," We saw what are the various scipy sub packages are available there."
"17.28"," So I hope those things are clear to you guys."
"19.44"," So today we will focus on one of the scipy sub package which is scipy.cluster."
"24.04"," And this session will see why do we use scipy.cluster, what exactly is"
"29.119999999999997"," clustering and how do we find clusters."
"32.0"," Okay, so I hope the agenda is clear to you guys."
"35.28"," So let's move ahead and see why do we use scipy.cluster."
"39.72"," Well, this sub package is very useful when we have to divide the data set into"
"44.239999999999995"," cluster based on some attributes."
"46.480000000000004"," So in the came in function, we have to pass the data and the number of clusters"
"50.8"," that we need to divide them in as the parameter."
"53.68"," Now a question might have popped into your head, right?"
"56.24"," Like what exactly is this clustering?"
"58.96"," So let's discuss that first."
"63.480000000000004"," So let's say we have a data set that looks something like this and you want to"
"66.8"," group them into two cluster, the green and the blue cluster."
"71.08"," So from here, you can say that clustering is the process of grouping similar items"
"75.76"," into one single group."
"77.68"," For example, you can say that we have selected two clusters over here, right?"
"81.67999999999999"," So all the data points and green cluster are completely different from all the"
"86.47999999999999"," data points in the blue cluster."
"88.19999999999999"," Okay, but all the points within the green cluster are quite similar to each other."
"94.11999999999999"," And same is the case with the blue cluster."
"96.32"," Okay, so summarizing it, you can say that clustering is a process in which the data"
"101.63999999999999"," points are clustered into groups."
"103.91999999999999"," The data points within one cluster are quite similar to each other."
"107.84"," But when you compare it to the data point in different cluster, it's completely different."
"113.08000000000001"," There is no similarity between them."
"115.24000000000001"," Okay, so now the question arises how to calculate this or how can we create this cluster?"
"121.76"," Okay, so let's see how to create this cluster."
"125.16000000000001"," So how do we find cluster?"
"126.80000000000001"," So first of all, we randomly pick two different cluster centers."
"131.0"," Okay, then as a step to what we'll do will assign our data set into two cluster based"
"136.32"," on minimum distance to the cluster centers."
"139.0"," Fine, then we'll calculate the mean distance of each member in the cluster."
"143.68"," Then as a step forward, we'll do will shift the cluster center towards the mean and"
"148.23999999999998"," we'll consider that two mean values are the new cluster centers."
"152.4"," Okay, then again, we'll repeat step two and step three until no member changes the"
"157.2"," group."
"158.2"," Okay, so I hope you got an idea of clustering from this."
"160.84"," So let us discuss with the help of an example to make it even more clear."
"165.12"," So let's say we have a data set in which we have coordinates as x, y, distance, k1,"
"170.68"," distance, k2, minimum and cluster."
"172.76"," So these are our attributes over there."
"175.8"," Distance, k1 is the distance between the point and the centroid of cluster one and distance"
"181.56"," k2 is the distance between the point and the centroid of cluster two."
"188.0"," So let's say we have a data set 1122445566 and we need to divide them into two different"
"194.6"," cluster."
"195.6"," So first of all, we'll randomly pick two cluster center or centroid."
"198.84"," Let's say k1 equal 3, 3 and k2 equal 5.1 and 5.1."
"203.51999999999998"," Okay, then what we'll do will calculate the distance from each point to k1 and k2 and"
"208.76"," based on the minimum distance, we'll assign them the clusters."
"211.68"," Okay, so for example, the distance from 11 to k1 is 8."
"216.2"," But that to k2, it's 33.62."
"219.84"," So clearly, her minimum distance is 8."
"222.2"," So our first point goes to cluster one."
"224.76"," From the point with coordinate 2,2, so the distance from k1 is 2."
"230.35999999999999"," But to k2 is 19.22."
"233.67999999999998"," So this also belongs to cluster k1 and similarly we'll find the distance for rest of the point"
"239.07999999999998"," and based on minimum distance, we'll put them into the different cluster."
"243.04"," Okay, so now after assigning the cluster, it looks something like this."
"246.88"," So cluster one has the point with coordinates 11, 22 and 44 and cluster two have the point"
"253.0"," with coordinates 55 and 66."
"255.76"," So our next task would be to find the mean of all the member in a cluster."
"259.68"," Okay, so the coordinate of mean of cluster one is 2.33, 2.33 and the coordinate of mean"
"267.6"," of cluster two is 5.5 and 5.5."
"270.48"," Okay, so now consider the coordinate 2.33, 2.33 and 5.5, 5.5."
"276.8"," as new k1 and k2."
"279.04"," Okay, again find the distance of each point from k1 and k2, then based on minimum distance,"
"284.92"," put them in clusters."
"286.52000000000004"," Okay, now repeat these steps until no member changes the cluster."
"291.48"," So in this example, we add very less number of data."
"293.76"," So the whole calculation with repeating steps doesn't look that annoying."
"297.64"," Right, but what happens if the data set is large, right?"
"300.88"," That would be 2 hectic task for you to calculate it manually."
"304.08"," So now to reduce this computational complexity, we have psi pi dot cluster."
"309.03999999999996"," Okay, now let me show you how you can use it and Python."
"313.91999999999996"," So to perform clustering operation, we had been needing some data."
"317.12"," So here I have imported some car data set using pandas."
"320.24"," Okay, so my data set consists of 11 columns and 32 rows and all these 32 rows consist"
"326.91999999999996"," of different numerical data."
"328.88"," Okay, here in this slide, I just shown first 13 rows of the data set."
"333.68"," So as you can see here, my data set consists of MPG, cylinder displacement, horsepower,"
"339.44"," E-dat, weight, QSEC, VSAM, gear, carburetor."
"343.84000000000003"," Right, so now we'll be using this data set to create the cluster."
"348.40000000000003"," Okay, so import pandas as PD data equal PD dot 3Dxil inside that the name of the file."
"355.84000000000003"," So there's how you can import the data."
"357.88"," Okay, so now to perform clustering operation, we first need to import k means and vq"
"363.32"," from the scipy dot clustering sub package."
"365.96"," Then we'll pass our data and the number of cluster that we need in k means function."
"370.52"," In our case, we need three clusters, right?"
"373.32"," So this k means function would return the array of three centroid."
"377.36"," Okay, so after we get the centroids, we'll pass our data and the centroids into the vector"
"382.24"," quantization function, which returns an array of cluster index values for each record."
"388.2"," So let's see the output."
"390.2"," So as you can see from the array of cluster index, our data set is divided into three different"
"394.84"," clusters."
"395.84"," It was simple, wasn't it?"
"397.92"," But there's a common pre pressing step for machine learning algorithm called the data"
"401.64"," widening."
"402.64"," We need to perform data widening when we use features that represents different character"
"407.48"," steps and are on very different scales."
"410.0"," So which we are seeing our data set."
"412.68"," Okay, so we'll now see if there is any change in the cluster after we perform widening."
"418.2"," Well, again, to perform data widening will be importing widen from scipy dot cluster dot"
"423.4"," vq."
"424.4"," Then after importing the data will pass the data set into the white function."
"428.67999999999995"," Then repeat the same steps to find the centroids and the array of index."
"432.88"," Now comparing to the array of cluster index, you can see that many of them has been changed."
"437.79999999999995"," Right in this and in this."
"442.64"," Okay, so this is why we need to perform data widening before passing the data into the"
"447.12"," k means clustering function."
"449.12"," So this was all about scipy dot cluster."
"452.12"," Okay."
