"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome back to Python certification course."
"8.08"," In our previous session we saw a brief introduction to machine learning."
"11.16"," We learned what exactly is machine learning and we also busted out some of the myth related"
"15.84"," to it."
"16.84"," Right?"
"17.84"," I hope those things are clear to you."
"19.16"," So our today's session is on what are the various types of machine learning."
"22.72"," So in today's session we'll learn what exactly is supervised learning one or type of machine"
"27.68"," learning and what are the real life use cases of supervised learning, what is unsupervised"
"32.48"," learning what are the various real life use cases of unsupervised learning, what is reinforcement"
"37.480000000000004"," learning and finally what are some of the real life use cases of reinforcement learning."
"42.56"," So without delaying any further."
"44.239999999999995"," Let's start with types of machine learning."
"47.239999999999995"," So in general we have three types of machine learning supervised learning unsupervised"
"51.96"," learning and reinforcement learning."
"53.7"," Let's see them one by one."
"56.12"," starting with supervised learning. So supervised learning is the one in which we have a training"
"61.16"," data set or you can say in which we have a label training data set and the machine is trained"
"66.12"," on that particular label, for example, so there's a teacher or there's a supervisor who supervised"
"72.28"," the entire process and trains the machine according to the label. For example, you can see up here,"
"77.64"," he has a teacher on the screen who is teaching the machine by showing different majors of the apple."
"82.84"," So once the machine is trained, so in future, when we show a different image of the apple,"
"88.84"," the machine can easily identify that it's an apple with some accuracy. Okay, for example,"
"94.76"," the image shown up here is an apple with 97% accuracy. So this is supervised learning."
"101.4"," So let's see some of the use cases of supervised learning. So first we have a spam classifier."
"106.12"," So how do you think your mail is getting classified as whether it's a spam mail or not a spam mail?"
"111.16"," Well, the spam detection basically works on the base of filter. These are settings that are"
"115.56"," constantly updated based on new technologies, new spam identification and the feedback given by"
"120.6"," Gmail user about potential spammers. Spam filter users either text filter or it eliminates the"
"127.08"," thread based on sender and their history, whether the sender was previously reported or not. Okay,"
"133.0"," so there are mainly two types of filters, text filters and client filter. Text filter work by"
"138.84"," using algorithm to detect which word and phrases are most often used in the spam email."
"144.12"," Frazes like lottery or you on a free bit point are often an immediate flag for removal by filters."
"151.0"," Spammers have gotten wise to this and often use blunt misspellings or even substitute of characters"
"156.52"," like free dollar character in order to make it pass the filter. Fortunately, the modern spam"
"161.96"," filter can also make advances for these type of misspellings and if a word comes up even with"
"167.32"," character substitution, the message will still be blocked. Next is the client filter."
"171.79999999999998"," An addition to the simple text filter algorithm that tops spam filter,"
"175.72"," users' client identity and history to block malicious or annoying spam email."
"180.76"," Now, how does a spam filter work? Well, this is done by looking at all the messages of a certain"
"186.04"," user with TR sent out. If they send out huge amounts of email constantly or if several of their"
"192.28"," messages are already being marked as spam through the text filter, then in that case their email"
"197.08"," will be blocked entirely. So this brings us to the use of blacklist. Spam filters also include a"
"202.84"," blacklist. Blacklisting is simply the process of adding the known email addresses of a spam or"
"208.44"," to a list. This list prevents any inbound messages from the email address going forward. If you are"
"214.36"," marked something as spam, it will directly go in this blacklist and it also helps Google to make a"
"219.64"," note of certain keywords found from that particular spam mail. So that's the outline of spam"
"224.67999999999998"," detection. The real-time process has a lot more complex and consume a lot of data."
"229.79999999999998"," Okay? Next is fingerprint analysis. So for fingerprint analysis, what do you do? You say your"
"235.72"," fingerprint in the machine as a record. So the machine checks the data and verifies whether"
"240.76"," this particular data belongs to you or not. Okay? So once the data is saved into the machine,"
"245.88000000000002"," so from next time whenever you put your fingerprint on the machine, what the machine does is scan through"
"250.84"," all of its data. And if the data is matched, then in that case your fingerprint is verified. There is"
"256.6"," another application of supervised learning. Next we have is unsupervised learning. Well in case of"
"262.52"," unsupervised learning, there is no teacher and there is no label. What the machine does, the machine"
"268.12"," identify clusters in it. It finds similar images and group them into a cluster. For example,"
"274.92"," over here, seeing some pattern in different images, the machine divides the entire image into"
"280.84000000000003"," three different clusters. Okay? Cluster 1, cluster 2, cluster 3. But the machine doesn't know that"
"287.40000000000003"," cluster 1 is an apple or cluster 2 as an orange or cluster 3 is a banana. All it knows that"
"292.76"," cluster 1 consists of similar item, cluster 2 consists of other similar item, which are not a"
"298.20000000000005"," tall related to cluster 1. And similarly cluster 3 consists of different item, which are completely"
"304.59999999999997"," different from cluster 1 and cluster 2. And cluster 3 consists of other similar item, which are"
"309.96"," completely different from the item of cluster 1 and cluster 2. Okay? So this is what unsupervised"
"315.79999999999995"," machine learning is. So one of the use case of unsupervised learning is voice based personal"
"321.4"," assistant. So the device which are seeing on your screen is Amazon Eco and the brain or the voice"
"326.84"," of Eco is known as Amazon Alexa. The device has many smart belt end to do a number of tasks like"
"333.0"," playback music, make the light blink. It also recognizes the name Alexa. It's like when you say"
"338.36"," the word, it recognizes the word and start recording your voice. Amazon calls this word as a"
"343.48"," wake word. So it's like when you are finished speaking, it sends the recording over to the internet"
"349.32"," to Amazon. The service that processes this recording is called Alexa voice services or AVS."
"355.72"," It's run by Amazon. This converts the recording into command that it integrates. It's more than a"
"361.08"," simple voice to text service. It is a fully programmable service that can work with other online"
"366.59999999999997"," services to do a large range of things for you. Once authorized by Amazon, anyone can use this service"
"372.68"," for free to build a homemade Eco. Amazon has also offered sample code for building an Eco using a"
"378.84"," Raspberry Pi, which is a simple $30 computer. It might sound extremely selfless of Amazon to provide"
"384.84"," the service for free. But as always, they have their reasons. Amazon won't other to build their"
"390.44"," service into their products so that they can sell you this stuff. So every product that has Alexa"
"396.04"," built in is a device that can be used to buy stuff from Amazon. These command that Alexa"
"401.71999999999997"," integrates can be very simple. It's like if you ask for a time, the AVS sends back an audio file"
"408.2"," to Alexa telling you the time, which the Eco plays back. They can also be more complex. If you ask"
"414.68"," Alexa to play a Pink Floyd, AVS will search the music service to have you set up for Pink Floyd."
"420.84000000000003"," And then send a command back to the Eco that sets it playing the requested music."
"425.64000000000004"," Alexa can also work with other technologies in her home. It's like you can even set up your"
"430.20000000000005"," Philips use smart lights to be controlled with Alexa. You can ask Alexa to turn on the living"
"435.08000000000004"," room lights and the Alexa will send a command to the Eco that sends a command to these light bulbs"
"440.91999999999996"," It can also work with various online services. You can link Alexa to Uber and you can request"
"446.44"," Uber-wise simply asking Alexa. You can link it to Dominos and you can just order a pizza with"
"451.47999999999996"," your voice. So this approach means that Alexa can do a lot of things for you. And the list is just"
"457.15999999999997"," getting longer. Amazon is adding more features and skills to Alexa. And if you're smart enough,"
"462.44"," you can build up on their own. So it means that you can use Alexa to control things that are not"
"467.4"," even on the list. Okay. Well, however, Alexa needs internet connectivity and AVS to work."
"473.15999999999997"," If your internet connection is slow or it's not working, then Alexa won't be available."
"477.88"," And your Eco will be useless. So if Amazon decides to charge for a service or just close it down,"
"483.4"," then in that case, you'll be just left with a useless device. Well, Amazon is not the only one in"
"488.52"," town. We have Google, Apple and Microsoft, which offers similar services that can perform tasks"
"494.36"," by voice command in the form of Okigoo, Google, Siri and Cortana. They use similar approach. Voice"
"500.52000000000004"," commands that are processed in a cloud service. But most of them are not as flexible or as integrated"
"506.04"," with other service as Alexa is. So whichever of these services end up being the one we all use,"
"512.04"," hopefully they will be as polite as Alexa. I'll just give you an example when I asked her how"
"516.92"," she works. She replied, lots of people had worked hard to teach me and I'm still learning more."
"522.68"," For it would be nice if all of our appliances were that modest and polite. Right. So let's move ahead."
"530.12"," So another use case of unsupervised learning is Netflix recommendation. So more than 80% of the"
"536.28"," TV shows that you guys watch on Netflix are discovered through the platform's recommendation system."
"541.16"," That means the majority of what you decide to watch on Netflix is the result of decisions made"
"546.04"," by mysterious black box of an algorithm. Let me just give you a brief of how it works."
"551.32"," Well, Netflix uses machine learning algorithm to recommend you the list of movies and fine shows"
"556.44"," that you might not have initially chosen. To do this, what it does, it looks through a thread"
"561.1600000000001"," within the content rather than relying on board genres to make a prediction. So this explains"
"566.44"," how one in eight people who watch Netflix Marvel shows are completely new to comic book based"
"571.32"," stuff on Netflix. Let me tell you about a guy named Tordielin. He's the Netflix vice-president of"
"576.92"," product innovation. He has explained the working of Netflix as a three legs stool. The three legs"
"582.12"," of this stool are Netflix members, the tagger who understands everything about the content and"
"587.3199999999999"," our machine learning algorithm that takes all of the data and puts them together. So Netflix has more"
"592.76"," than 100 million worldwide user. If we count the multiple user profile for each subscriber, it comes"
"598.52"," to around 250 million active profiles. Now Netflix uses different kind of data from these profiles"
"604.76"," like it keeps the track of what you guys are watching from your profile. What do you watch after"
"608.84"," completing your current video and even what you have watched earlier. It also keeps the track of what"
"613.88"," you have watched a year ago or what you're currently watching and at what time of the day. Well,"
"618.68"," this data is the first leg of the Metamorphical stool. Now what they do, they combine this information"
"625.16"," with more data to understand the content of the show that you are watching. The data is generated"
"629.88"," from dozens of in-house and freelance staff who watch every minute or every show on Netflix and"
"635.7199999999999"," target. Now all these tags and the user behavior data are taken and is fed to a very sophisticated"
"641.88"," machine learning algorithm that figures out what's most important and what should it weigh like."
"647.16"," Or how much should it matter if a consumer has watched something yesterday. Should that count"
"652.52"," twice as much or 10 times as much compared to what they have watched a whole year ago. How about"
"658.6800000000001"," a month ago or how about if they watch 10 minutes of the content and abandoned it or they binge"
"664.2"," throw it in two nights. So how do we weigh all that. Well, that's where machine learning comes in."
"669.08"," What those three things create for us is taste communities around the world. It's about people who"
"674.28"," watch same kinds of things that you watch. Viewers are fit into thousands of multiple taste"
"679.32"," groups and it's these that affect what recommendation pop up on the top of your screen. The tags that"
"685.72"," are used for machine learning algorithm are the same across the globe. However, a small subset of tags"
"691.32"," are used in more outward facing way feeding directly into the user interface and differing depending"
"696.76"," on a country language and cultural context. As the tags have to be localized in a way that make more"
"702.12"," sense. For example, if you know English and you're watching Hollywood movies or movies in English,"
"707.96"," then in that case Netflix won't recommend you German movies or Chinese movies or Japanese movies."
"714.84"," All right, the data that Netflix feed into its algorithm can be broken down into two types."
"720.4399999999999"," Implicit and explicit. Explicit is for example, you give a thumbs up to the series The Friends."
"725.72"," So the Netflix get it. Okay, and implicit data is mostly the behavioral data. It's like you didn't"
"731.72"," explicitly tell Netflix that you like black mirror, but you just binge on it and watch it in two"
"737.24"," nights. So the Netflix understands that behaviorally. So the majority of the data is implicit. So this"
"744.04"," was about how Netflix is using machine learning to recommend you the movies. Fine. So next we have"
"750.12"," is the reinforcement learning. Well, in reinforcement learning what we have is the agent and the"
"754.92"," environment. The agent selects some action using some policies. So there is no teacher in this case"
"760.1999999999999"," for training the machine. If the machine makes a right decision, the machine gets a positive point."
"764.92"," If it makes a wrong decision, it gets a negative point for it. So repeating the process again and"
"769.9599999999999"," again, the machine learns it. So this process is of reinforcement learning. So let's take the"
"774.5999999999999"," example of a self-driving car over here. So initially when the car was trained, so the car didn't know"
"780.1999999999999"," what way to choose. Okay. So what it did, it made an action, but the action it performed was wrong."
"786.68"," So it got a penalty of minus 50 points for that. So from the next time, car realized that what it"
"793.32"," did earlier was wrong and it updated its policy and then it errates the process. Okay. So this is"
"800.0400000000001"," reinforcement learning. So let me just explain you reinforcement learning with the concept of"
"804.5200000000001"," how Pavlo trained his dog using reinforcement learning. So this is a famous example of how Pavlo"
"811.24"," trained his dog using reinforcement learning. So it's like initially Pavlo gave food to the dog. So"
"817.5600000000001"," in response to the food, the dog started salivating. Okay. This was before conditioning. Then in the"
"823.24"," next phase, what he did, he just rang a bell for which the dog did not respond anything. Okay."
"828.9200000000001"," Then the third phase, what he did, he rang the bell and then gave him the food. So seeing the food,"
"834.04"," the dog started salivating again. Then after that, he repeated this third step again and again"
"839.4"," and again until the dog learned it. Then after conditioning, whenever Pavlo used to rang the bell,"
"845.0"," the dog started salivating. He understood that whenever the bell is going to ring, his master is"
"850.2"," going to give him the food. So this is how Pavlo trained his dog using reinforcement learning."
"855.32"," Okay. One of the application or the use case of reinforcement learning is self-driving car."
"861.4"," A recent study has shown that over 90% of road accidents are caused by human error. To"
"867.0"," others, human but behind the wheel, mistakes are often more catastrophic. Accidents have led to a"
"872.6"," massive number of unnecessary deaths. Life that could have been saved otherwise through self-driving."
"877.72"," So this is where self-driving cars comes into picture. The autonomous car or the self-driving"
"882.84"," cars are much safer than human driven cars. They are unaffected by factors like driver fatigue,"
"887.64"," emotions or illness. This makes them very safe."
"890.76"," Self-driving cars are always active and attentive, observing the environments and scanning multiple"
"896.28"," direction. It would be difficult to make a move that car has not anticipated. So how does a"
"901.96"," self-driving car work? Well, self-driving cars mainly rely on three technologies. IUD sensors,"
"908.44"," IUD connectivity and software algorithm. There are many types of sensors available for a self-driving"
"913.48"," car. For example, sensor for blind spot monitoring, forward collision, warning, radar, camera,"
"919.32"," lidar and ultrasonic. So all of these IUD sensors work together to make navigation of a self-driving car."
"925.72"," Next is the IUD connectivity. Cell driving cars uses cloud computing to act upon traffic data,"
"931.4"," weather, maps, adjacent cars and surface conditioning among others. This helps them to monitor"
"936.84"," their surroundings better and make informed decisions. And next is the software algorithm."
"941.8"," All the data the car collects need to be analyzed to determine the best course of action."
"946.4399999999999"," There is the main function of the control algorithm and software and this is where reinforcement"
"951.16"," learning comes into picture. There is the most complex part of the self-driving car since it has"
"956.52"," to make the vision flawless. A flaw like in case of over self-driving car can be fatal."
"962.68"," In today's world, the most famous self-driving car are those from Tesla and Google. Tesla cars"
"967.72"," work by analyzing the environment using a software system known as Autopilot. Autopilot uses"
"972.76"," high-tech cameras to view and collect data from the world, same as what we do with our eyes."
"978.28"," It's called as computer vision or sophisticated image recognition. It then interprets this"
"983.72"," information and makes the best decisions based on it. So this was one of the use case of"
"989.32"," reinforcement learning."
