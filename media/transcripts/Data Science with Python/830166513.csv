"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome all to this Python certification course."
"8.22"," In our previous session we learnt about how to create and customize a histogram plot."
"12.46"," I hope those things are clear to you."
"14.18"," So our today's session is on how to create a box plot and a violent plot."
"18.26"," So in this session we'll learn about how you can create a box plot and how to create"
"22.98"," a violent plot."
"24.3"," So without delaying any further let's quickly jump back to our Jupyter notebook and see"
"28.32"," how you can create them."
"29.62"," So let me just open my Jupyter notebook."
"31.86"," So this is my Jupyter notebook."
"33.46"," So the very first thing that I'll be doing up here is creating a box plot."
"37.86"," So how to create a box plot."
"42.900000000000006"," So the very first thing that you need to do is import your Matplot lib library."
"46.74"," So import Matplot lib.pyplot."
"51.02"," Import it as PLT."
"52.86"," Percentage Matplot lib."
"55.6"," Online."
"57.120000000000005"," So now that we have imported our Matplot lib library."
"59.84"," So next task that we need to perform is prepare our data."
"63.32"," So next step is the data preparation step."
"67.88"," So let's define three variables up here."
"70.44"," First one is total."
"72.32000000000001"," So let's define three different lists up here."
"74.84"," So first is total."
"77.08"," So let's say total consists of 20, 4, 1, 30, 20, 10, 20, 70, 30 and 10."
"85.52"," My next list is of order."
"88.28"," And this order consists of let's say 10, 3, 1, 15, 17, 2, 30, 44, 2, 1, any random"
"97.28"," values."
"98.28"," And discount."
"100.92"," So my discount equals 30%, 10%, 20%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 50%, 60%, 20%, 45%."
"113.44"," Now let's define a list data, which it consists of all these parameters."
"118.0"," So my list is total, order and discount."
"122.8"," Okay."
"123.8"," So now the data preparation step is complete."
"125.72"," So the next thing that I want to do is plot my data."
"128.2"," So for that, I'll just write here plotting the data."
"132.44"," Here I'll just write PLT.boxplot inside this as the data."
"137.68"," And I want to see the actual mean of these data."
"140.12"," So I can just write show means equal true."
"143.08"," So you can also title to your box plot like PLT.title inside this."
"148.08"," Mention the title as box plot demo."
"152.24"," Next let's define the grid."
"153.84"," So plot.grid true."
"156.36"," And finally let's visualize our plot."
"158.32000000000002"," So PLT.show."
"159.32000000000002"," Let's execute it."
"161.56"," So this is our required box plot."
"163.28"," Okay."
"164.28"," This box plot is very helpful in viewing the summary of a data set in a efficient way."
"167.8"," Also the box plot helps you in doing outer analysis."
"170.6"," So here these points up here, these represents the outlier."
"173.72"," There's the minimum point."
"174.92"," There's the maximum point."
"175.92"," There's the range of points."
"177.07999999999998"," Okay."
"178.07999999999998"," So this is basically representing the range of point with your minimum value at this level."
"182.51999999999998"," And there's your maximum value level."
"184.32"," Fine."
"185.32"," And this green triangle which you can see up here is nothing but the mean value."
"188.48"," Okay."
"189.48"," So this was about the box plot."
"190.56"," So let's just move ahead and see how to create a violent plot."
"193.92"," So our next topic is how to create a violent plot."
"201.6"," For violent plot I can just reuse this code."
"204.68"," Let's just copy and paste it."
"206.48"," Well, generally this violent plot is used to visualize a distribution of a numeric variable"
"211.28"," for one or several rows."
"212.72"," It's generally used when the amount of data is pretty huge and showing individual observation"
"218.12"," get impossible."
"219.12"," Okay."
"220.12"," So the only change that I need to do up here is PLT."
"223.07999999999998"," Violent plot."
"224.4"," Well, in general you'll be using it when you are having a large amount of data and showing"
"228.76"," individual observation is almost impossible."
"231.44"," Okay."
"232.44"," So here data show means you can also add the median."
"236.2"," So show median make it true."
"239.48"," Okay."
"240.48"," And you can change the title to violent plot demo."
"244.07999999999998"," Fine."
"245.07999999999998"," And grid is already defined."
"246.28"," Lot."
"247.28"," Show executed."
"248.28"," S is missing up here."
"249.88"," So this is my violent plot."
"251.64"," So this was all for this session."
"253.07999999999998"," And our next session will learn about image plot."
