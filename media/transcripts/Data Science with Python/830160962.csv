"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome all to the Spiden certification course."
"8.1"," So our today's session is based on introduction to pandas."
"11.18"," So without delaying any further, let's discuss the agenda for today's session."
"14.76"," So we'll start our session by telling you what exactly is pandas."
"18.32"," Then we'll move ahead to see who created pandas and when."
"21.68"," Once we are done with this, then I'll tell you about some of the important features"
"24.78"," of pandas and finally we'll compare pandas with nambai."
"28.6"," I hope today's agenda is clear for you."
"30.6"," So let's start with what exactly is pandas."
"33.22"," Well, pandas are open source, simple and powerful Python library,"
"36.52"," which is mainly used for data manipulation and data analysis."
"40.0"," Okay. Now you might be wondering, where does this name panda come from?"
"44.04"," So what do you think?"
"44.96"," It's the name of an animal."
"46.36"," Is it wrong?"
"47.28"," The name panda is derived from the word panel data."
"50.32"," Okay. Now what is panel data?"
"52.0"," Well, this is our panel data."
"53.64"," It's a multi-dimensional data involving measurements over time."
"56.84"," Okay."
"57.34"," It consists of various attributes with different attribute value."
"61.02"," Okay."
"62.02"," So this is how the name panda came from from the word panel data."
"64.98"," Okay."
"65.98"," Now the question arises, who created pandas?"
"69.06"," Well, pandas was created by an American software developer and a businessman named"
"73.38"," Wes Meckany in the year 2015."
"76.14"," Okay."
"77.14"," So this is the guy who created pandas."
"78.7"," Now let's move ahead and see some of the features of pandas."
"81.22"," So our number one we have is series object and data frame."
"85.17999999999999"," Well, this is the primary and one of the most important features of panda."
"88.89999999999999"," It allows it to deal with one dimensional and two-dimensional label data in the form"
"93.41999999999999"," of series object and data frame."
"95.46"," Don't worry, we'll discuss about them in detail later in our session."
"98.5"," Okay. Next, so number two we have is handling of missing data."
"103.06"," Well, whenever you have a missing data, panda presented as NAM."
"107.38"," Okay."
"107.88"," So this is how panda easily handles the missing data."
"111.14"," Well, no matter where your data is a floating point data or it's a non-floating point data,"
"116.5"," panda handles the missing data very easily by representing the missing data as NAM."
"121.74"," Okay."
"122.74"," Next feature is data alignment."
"124.41999999999999"," Well, this says that the object can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels or the user"
"129.57999999999998"," can simply ignore the label and let series, data frames, etc. automatically align the"
"134.66"," data for you in computations."
"136.57999999999998"," Okay."
"137.57999999999998"," Next point we have is group by functionality."
"139.82"," Well, this is a very powerful and flexible function provided by pandas."
"143.42"," It is used to perform split, apply and combine operations on data for both aggregating and"
"149.02"," transforming the data."
"150.26"," Okay. Next, on number five, we have is slicing, indexing and subsitting."
"155.02"," Well, using pandas, you can perform intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing and"
"159.98"," subsitting large data set."
"161.62"," So we'll see in this module how we can perform all these functions using pandas."
"166.22"," Okay. Let's see some more features of panda."
"169.06"," Next we have is merging and joining."
"171.34"," Well, using panda, you can perform both merging and joining operations on your data set."
"175.34"," Okay. Next is reshaping."
"176.94"," Well, you can easily reshape your data and pivot your data points using pandas."
"181.18"," Okay. Next is hierarchical labeling of axes."
"185.18"," Well, this hierarchical labeling of axes allows you to have multiple labels per day and"
"190.22"," this can be done using pandas."
"192.5"," Next is robust input output tool."
"195.10000000000002"," Well, panda is a robust input output tool for loading data from flat files in"
"198.98"," including CSV and eliminated files from flat files like CSV or Excel files, databases and"
"205.42"," saving or loading data from the ultrafast SDF file format."
"208.94"," Okay. And finally, the last feature that we have is time series specific functionality."
"213.33999999999997"," Well, this time series specific functionality include date range generation frequency conversion,"
"218.89999999999998"," moving window statistics, moving window linear regression, date shift, and lagging, etc."
"224.14"," So all these types of function can be performed in time series using panda."
"229.29999999999998"," Okay. So these were some of the features of panda."
"232.05999999999997"," Now let's move ahead and compare panda with numpy."
"235.1"," So you might be thinking there are so many functions and features that make pandas and"
"238.85999999999999"," numpy quite similar."
"240.22"," But what exactly is the reason that we are preferring panda while dealing with some of the data"
"244.54"," then? Let's discuss that with the help of a comparison between panda and numpy."
"248.89999999999998"," So the first point that we have is panda works better with numpy while dealing with data"
"253.54"," which has more than 500,000 rows."
"256.02"," Okay. And when you are using numpy, so it performed better for 50,000 rows or less."
"261.42"," Okay. So in working with large real world data, you would need panda for computation."
"265.78"," Okay. Next we have is panda series object is more flexible as you can use it to define"
"271.86"," your own label index to index and access elements of an array."
"276.18"," On the other hand, element and numpy arrays are accessed by the default integer position."
"280.62"," Correct. So this is how pandas different from numpy."
"284.14"," So now that you know how pandas differ from numpy, next we'll see how we can import pandas"
"289.98"," in python."
"291.98"," So for that, we have a command import pandas as PD."
"295.82"," That's it."
"296.82"," Okay."
"297.82"," Next is what kind of data does suit pandas the most?"
"301.66"," So we have tabular data, time series data and arbitrary matrix data."
"305.7"," All of these kind of data you can feed it to the pandas."
"309.06"," So now that we have learned the history features and how to import panda, let us dive deep"
"313.58"," and see what kind of data suits pandas the most."
"316.82"," So deals with tabular data with heterogeneously typed columns as an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet."
"323.02"," You can also work with ordered and unordered time series data and it also helps you to work"
"327.9"," on arbitrary matrix data with rows and column labels."
"331.46"," Okay. So guys, this was all for the introduction to pandas."
"335.3"," So in our next session, we'll start working with pandas and we'll learn about data structures"
"339.42"," in panda."
