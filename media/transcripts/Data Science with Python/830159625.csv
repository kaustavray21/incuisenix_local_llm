"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome all to the Spiden certification course."
"8.52"," In our previous session we learned about Num by Array Mathematics in which we covered"
"13.120000000000001"," various functions such as Sum, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Exponent, Log etc."
"20.48"," Right, we also covered the concept of Broadcasting."
"23.2"," So I hope all these things are clear to you."
"25.2"," In case you have any doubt, feel free to reach out on Telepath 24, 7 and we will try to resolve"
"29.88"," your query at the earliest."
"31.88"," So this was about our previous session."
"33.8"," So in our today's session we will be learning about indexing and slicing and python and"
"37.879999999999995"," we will see how to select certain elements from the array."
"41.2"," So let's start with what exactly is indexing and slicing?"
"44.44"," Well, indexing just refers to a Poison."
"47.519999999999996"," For example, if you are storing some numbers or a string in an array, so each cell of"
"53.32"," an array has some index number associated to it."
"56.64"," For example, the image shown on your screen represents an array in which each cell has"
"61.56"," a different character."
"63.120000000000005"," So we have Monty Python stored in an array."
"66.76"," So here index number of m is 0, 0, 1 and so on till n is 11."
"73.48"," So this is the index number when you are going from top to down."
"76.96000000000001"," Okay."
"77.96000000000001"," And suppose if you directly want to extract the last character from the string and you"
"81.44"," don't know what is the length of the string."
"83.44"," So in that case, you can use the negative index number."
"86.64"," It starts from minus 1 at the end and goes till minus 12 at the beginning."
"92.36"," Let me just show you an example and make things more clear to you."
"95.24"," So there's a jippetanode book."
"96.72"," So let's define an array a equal Monty Python."
"100.03999999999999"," So each character is stored in a different cell."
"102.47999999999999"," Okay."
"103.47999999999999"," So now what if I want to extract Monty from here?"
"106.28"," So how will I do that?"
"107.28"," So this is a of Monty that m m starts from cell number 0 and it will end till m o n t y 0,"
"114.28"," 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5."
"118.72"," So before the colon, we write the part which is included."
"122.16"," So m is included."
"123.48"," So after the colon, that is cell with index number 5 is not included."
"127.76"," So just before 5."
"129.72"," So it's like 0 to 4."
"131.64"," Let's see the output."
"132.64"," So here we got the output as m 1, t y."
"135.32"," Now what if I want to extract, let's say these characters start from 0, 1, 2, right?"
"141.72"," Start from 2, ends at 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9."
"146.88"," So I'll just write 0 to start from 2 and end before 9."
"151.64"," So this was my requirement and I got the output as n, t y, p y, t."
"163.6"," So this was a very basic example of indexing and slicing and Python."
"167.68"," Let's move ahead to learn more about it."
"169.64"," So let's learn how to slice our three cross three dimensional array with the numbers"
"173.56"," 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 stored in them."
"177.35999999999999"," Okay."
"178.35999999999999"," So let's learn how to extract or slice the array."
"181.0"," So what if I want to extract the selected element?"
"183.51999999999998"," So here my selection is in first row, right?"
"186.72"," That is 0 with index."
"188.28"," So I can directly extract with a of 0."
"190.56"," So if I write a of 0, this includes all the element from the first row."
"194.24"," That is 1, 2, 3."
"195.48"," But when I write colon 1, it means you don't have to include 1."
"199.8"," That is whatever part comes after colon, we have to exclude that part."
"204.64000000000001"," That is we have to take number just before that."
"207.08"," That is if colon 1 is there, so we'll take till 0."
"210.52"," And this will extract the first row from the array."
"213.32"," The first one, it extracts all the elements from the first row and next one, it extracts"
"217.72"," the first row from the entire array."
"220.07999999999998"," What if I want to select these elements?"
"222.32"," So here my selection is in the first row, right?"
"224.83999999999997"," That is 0 with index."
"226.32"," So if I write a of colon 1, now how to extract this selected element?"
"230.88"," Well, in this, I know that my selection lies in the first row, right?"
"234.44"," That is 0 with index."
"236.32"," Now I'll write a colon 1."
"239.23999999999998"," So what it will do?"
"240.44"," It will extract the entire first row or extract will row equal 0."
"244.76"," Only this row will be extracted."
"246.35999999999999"," Next, I don't want to include the part of 0, 0."
"248.88"," So I want my selection to start from column 1."
"252.2"," OK, so I'll write 1 colon up here."
"254.72"," So after writing 1 colon, what it did from the 0th row, it then selected the column index"
"260.24"," starting from 1 till last."
"262.71999999999997"," And therefore we got a selected value."
"264.71999999999997"," Let me show you this example in my Jupyter notebook."
"267.15999999999997"," Let's define an array."
"268.32"," Let's say a equal np dot array inside this."
"273.96"," 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, 8, 9."
"279.35999999999996"," OK, so let's extract the first array from here."
"282.35999999999996"," Let's extract first array."
"283.88"," So we saw a of 0, a of 0 gives us all the element from the first row."
"288.76"," Next, if I write a of colon 1, but this will extract the first array, fine?"
"294.71999999999997"," Next, what if I want to extract 2, 3 from here?"
"297.88"," OK, first let me just show you the entire array."
"300.56"," So there's our array."
"301.59999999999997"," Now I want to extract 2, 3 from here."
"303.68"," So how I'll write a first select the entire."
"306.12"," So 2, 3, lies in first row."
"308.16"," Right."
"308.48"," So I have to select the entire row."
"310.16"," Then it should end at 2, 3."
"312.44"," Then my 2, 3 starts from column number 1."
"315.88"," So I'll write 1 and 1 till last."
"318.64"," OK, execute it."
"319.8"," So we will get the output as 2, 3."
"321.8"," Go back."
"322.64"," Now this is our requirement."
"324.08"," So how to extract the selected element?"
"326.12"," So in this, my selection lies in first two rows."
"329.16"," Right."
"329.32"," That is 0 and 1 index."
"331.48"," So here, if I write a of colon 2, so this will extract both the row 0 and the row 1."
"337.12"," OK, but now I want my column number to start from 1."
"340.40000000000003"," So I'll just write colon 2 and start from 1 till end."
"343.6"," OK, let me show you this as an example."
"346.0"," So there I wanted to extract 2, 3 and 5, 6."
"349.96000000000004"," Right."
"350.44"," So let's see how can I do that?"
"352.24"," So a of 2, 3 and 5, 6."
"354.76"," These numbers are the selection lies in first two rows."
"357.72"," So starting from 0 before 2, that is still 1."
"361.8"," So select all the rows from 0 to 1."
"364.96000000000004"," Then in the column part, the column starts from 1."
"368.28000000000003"," Right."
"368.96000000000004"," 0, 1, 2."
"370.56"," So it will start from here."
"372.08000000000004"," Right."
"372.28000000000003"," So it should start from 1 and it can end till last."
"375.84000000000003"," So let's execute it."
"376.84000000000003"," So in this case, we will get the output as 2, 3 and 5, 6."
"380.08000000000004"," 2, 3, 5, 6."
"381.52000000000004"," Yeah, let's move ahead."
"382.96000000000004"," Again, same example."
"384.40000000000003"," This one you can work it out on your own."
"386.16"," Can you say what's the answer for this?"
"388.32000000000005"," Let me give this a solution on this."
"389.68"," So a of 1 colon comma."
"391.48"," So what does it mean?"
"392.48"," Start from row number 1."
"394.0"," So there's our row number 1 till end."
"395.88000000000005"," So include everything from here."
"398.08000000000004"," OK."
"398.28000000000003"," So we have a of 1 colon comma."
"400.76000000000005"," OK, so what does it mean?"
"402.12"," So it means extracting starts from row number 1 till end."
"406.08000000000004"," This is my row number 1 till end."
"407.76000000000005"," So this will include all of these values."
"410.16"," 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9."
"412.04"," And it should continue till 1 colon, which means"
"415.72"," after extracting all the elements from row number 1 till the end,"
"419.72"," that is row 1 and row 2, when all these elements are included."
"423.36"," From these element, I want to start from colon number 1."
"427.28000000000003"," That is from here till the end."
"429.16"," So the output I'll be getting is 5, 6, 8, 9."
"432.64000000000004"," Let me just show you."
"434.12"," So I want to extract 5, 6, 8, 9."
"438.04"," So a of here 5, 6, 8, 9."
"441.0"," So these lies in first and second row."
"443.56"," So row should start from 1 and till last."
"448.24"," And my column, column 5, 6, 8, 9,"
"450.88"," let's start from first column, right?"
"452.64"," 0, 1, 2."
"453.72"," Even the column should start from first and till last."
"456.76"," So here I'll be getting the output as 5, 6, 8, 9."
"460.0"," So here are a few more examples that you can try."
