"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome back to our Python certification course."
"8.72"," In our last session we saw various method to initialize a NampaI array."
"13.32"," Correct?"
"14.32"," So today in this session we will learn about NampaI array inspection and we will see how"
"18.76"," we can inspect various aspects of a NampaI array."
"23.2"," So let's start it."
"25.88"," So the very first thing we got up here is NDRA.SHAPE."
"29.8"," Well this SHAPE function is used to return a tuple consisting of array dimension."
"35.0"," It can also be used to resize the array."
"37.8"," Let's check the shape of our array."
"43.760000000000005"," So what we have to do up here is inspecting the array."
"51.56"," So in this basically what we are doing is checking the size of the array."
"60.56"," So let's define our array up here like a equal Np dot array."
"68.56"," Let's define our array as 234,446."
"76.56"," Is it correct?"
"77.56"," Or am I missing something?"
"79.56"," Remember these square brackets at the beginning?"
"82.56"," Right."
"83.56"," So you have to add these square brackets if you want to know where the error is."
"87.56"," Now I have defined my array."
"91.56"," So now what I want to do?"
"92.56"," I want to check the size of my array."
"94.56"," So I'll just write print a dot shape."
"97.56"," Execute it."
"98.56"," So you got the output up here as 2,3."
"101.56"," So it means it's an array of dimension 2 cross 3."
"105.56"," Okay."
"106.56"," So what if I just change my array?"
"108.56"," Okay."
"109.56"," So let's just define our array like s equal Np dot array."
"114.56"," Let's define our array of different dimension like 1,2,3,4."
"118.56"," Another 2,3,4,6."
"122.56"," Let's define one more."
"124.56"," 6,7,8,9."
"127.56"," So what do you think would be the dimension of this array?"
"130.56"," Guess the output?"
"131.56"," Any answer anyone?"
"133.56"," We have three parameters up here."
"135.56"," Let's just compare these two values."
