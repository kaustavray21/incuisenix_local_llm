"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome back to our Python certification course."
"8.72"," In our last session we saw various method to initialize a NampaI array."
"13.280000000000001"," Correct?"
"14.280000000000001"," So today in this session we will learn about NampaI array inspection and we will see how"
"18.72"," we can inspect various aspects of a NampaI array."
"23.2"," So let's start it."
"25.88"," So the very first thing we got up here is NDRA.SHAPE."
"29.8"," Well this SHAPE function is used to return a tuple consisting of array dimension."
"35.0"," It can also be used to resize the array."
"37.8"," Let's check the shape of our array."
"43.760000000000005"," So what we have to do up here is inspecting the array."
"51.56"," So in this basically what we are doing is checking the size of the array."
"60.56"," So let's define our array up here like a equal Np dot array."
"68.56"," Let's define our array as 234,446."
"76.56"," Is it correct?"
"77.56"," Or am I missing something?"
"79.56"," Remember these square brackets at the beginning?"
"82.56"," Right."
"83.56"," So you have to add these square brackets if you want to know where the error is."
"87.56"," Now I have defined my array."
"91.56"," So now what I want to do?"
"92.56"," I want to check the size of my array."
"94.56"," So I'll just write print a dot shape."
"97.56"," Execute it."
"98.56"," So you got the output up here as 2,3."
"101.56"," So it means it's an array of dimension 2 cross 3."
"105.56"," Okay."
"106.56"," So what if I just change my array?"
"108.56"," Okay."
"109.56"," So let's just define our array like s equal Np dot array."
"114.56"," Let's define our array of different dimension like 1,2,3,4."
"118.56"," Another 2,3,4,6."
"122.56"," Let's define one more."
"124.56"," 6,7,8,9."
"127.56"," So what do you think would be the dimension of this array?"
"130.56"," Guess the output?"
"131.56"," Any answer anyone?"
"133.56"," We have three parameters up here."
"135.56"," Let's just compare these two values."
"138.56"," So here we had two set of arrays."
"140.56"," Right?"
"141.56"," And three elements in each array."
"143.56"," So while printing the shape, we got the output as 2,3."
"147.56"," Right?"
"148.56"," 2,1,2,3."
"152.56"," So what do you think here the output will be?"
"155.56"," We will here."
"156.56"," We have 1,2,3,4."
"159.56"," Four elements in each array."
"161.56"," And how many arrays we have?"
"163.56"," 1,2,3."
"164.56"," So what do you think the output will be?"
"166.56"," 3,4."
"167.56"," Right."
"168.56"," So we'll get the output as 3,4."
"170.56"," Just add these square back at the end."
"174.56"," In the end."
"175.56"," Okay?"
"176.56"," Is it good?"
"177.56"," At a dot shape, we have to print s dot shape."
"179.56"," Right?"
"180.56"," So we got the output as 3,4."
"183.56"," Correct?"
"185.56"," Now what if I want to resize my array?"
"201.56"," So what do you want to do up here is resize the array."
"206.56"," Right?"
"208.56"," Okay."
"209.56"," Let's see how can we do that?"
"213.56"," For that, let's just copy this array up here."
"218.56"," Okay?"
"220.56"," Well, even if you don't specify it, that won't be an issue,"
"226.56"," but don't know yet."
"227.56"," I'll discuss it later."
"228.56"," So for now, let's define the same array."
"231.56"," And as we know, the shape of this array was this 2 cross 3."
"237.56"," Right?"
"238.56"," Now what if I want the shape to be changed as 3 cross 2?"
"242.56"," So what I'll do up here is I'll just write a dot shape."
"245.56"," And I want to change it to 3 cross 2."
"249.56"," Okay?"
"250.56"," Now let's just print the value of a."
"256.56"," Let's execute it."
"258.56"," Okay."
"259.56"," So we got the value as 2,3,4,4,4,6,2,3,4,4,4,4,6."
"266.56"," Okay?"
"267.56"," So I just resize the array and change the dimension."
"272.56"," Okay?"
"273.56"," Let's see one more example."
"277.56"," Let's change the dimension."
"279.56"," Like for 4."
"281.56"," Here, let's write 2,4,4,6."
"283.56"," Okay?"
"284.56"," Now, how many elements do we have?"
"287.56"," 1,2,3,4,5,6,7?"
"288.56"," 8 elements we have."
"290.56"," So now I want the array of dimension 8 cross 1."
"293.56"," So since 8 elements are only there, so 8 cross 1."
"297.56"," So now I'll get the output as 2,3,4,4,4,4,6."
"301.56"," Okay?"
"302.56"," But yeah, you cannot just write random numbers out here."
"305.56"," It's like if you'll write 8,2, you might get an error in this case,"
"309.56"," as no elements are up there."
"311.56"," So you got an error of cannot reshape array of size 8 into shape of 8,2."
"316.56"," Since the number of elements that you have is just 8."
"320.56"," So maximum, what you can have is 8 cross 1."
"325.56"," Okay?"
"326.56"," So similarly, you can also get 4 cross 2."
"329.56"," It will be correct."
"331.56"," Okay?"
"332.56"," So the trick up here is, let me tell you the trick."
"336.56"," Start trick."
"338.56"," The multiplication of these two numbers."
"340.56"," Must be equal to the total number of elements."
"343.56"," Okay?"
"344.56"," So x multiplied by y should be equal to total number of elements in the array."
"354.56"," Okay?"
"355.56"," So 4 cross 2, 2 cross 4 or what else?"
"359.56"," That's it, right?"
"361.56"," The factors of 8 are 2,4,8,1."
"364.56"," We tried with the 1."
"366.56"," Okay?"
"367.56"," Let's just change it to 8,1."
"369.56"," So this is the output."
"371.56"," Got it?"
"374.56"," So this is how we are resizing our array."
"377.56"," Okay?"
"378.56"," Next, what if I want to check the dimension of my array?"
"381.56"," How will I do that?"
"383.56"," So just now, I check the shape of my array."
"385.56"," Now, what if I want to print the dimension of my array?"
"388.56"," So how will I do that?"
"390.56"," So for that, we have a end-imfunction."
"392.56"," All right?"
"393.56"," Let's see how we're going to do it."
"395.56"," So what task we have is?"
"399.56"," The return, the dimension of the array."
"402.56"," Okay?"
"403.56"," Let's see how we'll proceed."
"405.56"," So let's define an array as a equal np.a range 24."
"411.56"," So here, what I did, it created me an array from 0 to 23."
"416.56"," Okay?"
"417.56"," So now, what I want to do, I want to check the dimension of this particular array."
"422.56"," I'll just write print a.endim."
"426.56"," So end-im is the function which will return me the dimension of this particular array."
"430.56"," So what do you think the dimension of this array is?"
"433.56"," And yes, it's one, right?"
"436.56"," So the dimension of this particular array was 1."
"439.56"," Now, since that we have defined a single-dimensional array, let's just reshape it."
"444.56"," So here, we are reshaping our array."
"449.56"," So for reshaping, let's defy our another variable as b equal a dot reshape in the dimension of"
"455.56"," 2, 4 and 3."
"459.56"," So here, as a part of dimension, you can use any number whose product is 24."
"463.56"," So for that, when trick is there, like what you can do is first calculate the factors of 24."
"474.56"," What are those?"
"475.56"," 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 and 24 itself."
"481.56"," Right?"
"482.56"," So here, what all value it can take?"
"484.56"," So here, you can select only number from 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 and 24."
"490.56"," So it's like if you are selecting 1, another would be 1."
"493.56"," If 2, then 2 cross 3, it's 6, 6 cross 4, it's 24."
"498.56"," So here, we took as 2, 4, 3 or you can even take 2, 3, 4, anything."
"503.56"," If you are taking 6, then 6 multiplied by 2 is 12."
"508.56"," And again, multiplied by 2 is 24."
"511.56"," So you can even reshape this array to a dimension of 6 cross 2 cross 2."
"517.56"," Okay?"
"518.56"," Let me just print the dimension of b and show you the output."
"521.56"," So what is the dimension of b array?"
"524.56"," Let's see."
"525.56"," And them executed."
"526.56"," So here, we got the output as 3."
"528.56"," This is from the previous thing, only just remove it."
"531.56"," So here, the dimension of b is 3, 3 dimensional array."
"535.56"," Right?"
"536.56"," If you change it to like what?"
"538.56"," Let's change it to 12, 2."
"541.56"," This will work, right?"
"542.56"," And the dimension of this array would be 2, right?"
"545.56"," It's a 2 dimensional array."
"547.56"," Okay."
"548.56"," Got it?"
"549.56"," So basically in reshape up here, what we are specifying is the value of x, y and z coordinate."
"555.56"," Okay?"
"556.56"," Since we are not specifying z coordinate, so it's a 2 dimensional variable."
"559.56"," And the value of x is 12 and the value of y is 2."
"563.56"," So we need a 12 cross 2 matrix up here."
"567.56"," Let's even print b."
"569.56"," Let's see what we get."
"571.56"," So you will get the output something like this."
"574.56"," So 12 and a column and 2 and a row."
"576.56"," Okay?"
"577.56"," So now you know how to find out the dimension of any array and how you can reshape any array to your need."
"582.56"," Right?"
"583.56"," Let's move ahead."
"585.56"," Now, what if I just want to return the number of elements in an array?"
"589.56"," How will I do that?"
"591.56"," So find the number of elements in an array."
"598.56"," Let's see."
"599.56"," We have already defined an array a up here."
"602.56"," Right?"
"603.56"," Sorry."
"604.56"," Here's our a equivalent p dot a range 24."
"607.56"," So our array a consists of 24 numbers that we already know."
"612.56"," Now, how do you find the number of elements in an array?"
"615.56"," So up here, we have already defined an array as a equivalent p dot a range 24."
"621.56"," Okay?"
"622.56"," So here we already know that number of elements in an array is 24."
"626.56"," Since we are only defining it."
"628.56"," So what if you get a scenario in which you don't know how many elements are present in the array?"
"633.56"," So for that, we'll be using size function up here."
"636.56"," Right?"
"637.56"," Let me just verify how size function work."
"639.56"," So currently, you know how many elements are there and it's 24."
"642.56"," You have only defined it."
"644.56"," So in order to find out the number of elements in an array, all you need to do is use a function size."
"649.56"," So name of the array a dot size."
"653.56"," That's it."
"654.56"," Execute it."
"655.56"," So we got the output as 24 and it's verified."
"658.56"," So even you have initialized the array with 24 elements."
"662.56"," Right?"
"663.56"," And this function has verified this."
"664.56"," Or if I just change it, let me just show you."
"667.56"," Let's change it to 25."
"669.56"," Let's remove this."
"673.56"," Okay?"
"674.56"," Let's print our size."
"676.56"," Well, the output up here would be."
"678.56"," And yes, 25, obviously."
"681.56"," Right?"
"682.56"," Okay?"
"683.56"," So this is how you count the number of elements in your array."
"686.56"," Let me just take one more example."
"688.56"," Let's define an array as a equal 1, 2, 3, 4."
"695.56"," Okay?"
"696.56"," comma 3, 4, 5, 6, comma 2, 3, 7, 9."
"702.56"," Okay?"
"703.56"," So this is my new array."
"705.56"," Let's name it as d."
"708.56"," Okay?"
"709.56"," Now let's print the size of d."
"711.56"," When the elements are present in d, d dot size."
"716.56"," So let's see what's the output."
"719.56"," So we have to define a tuple up here."
"721.56"," Okay?"
"722.56"," Tuple object has no attribute size."
"725.56"," Let's take one more example up here."
"727.56"," So here, let's define our array as d equal to np dot array."
"733.56"," Inside this, let's define few arrays like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 6, 7, 8."
"749.56"," Okay?"
"750.56"," Now let's just print d dot size."
"755.56"," So this will return the number of elements present in d."
"760.56"," And the output is 9, 3, 3, 3."
"763.56"," Okay?"
"764.56"," Well, what if I just add one more element up here, like 8, 9."
"768.56"," So what should we output?"
"770.56"," Should be."
"771.56"," So once you add it 9 up here, we got d output as 3."
"774.56"," Well, I know you are wondering that we'd be getting the output as 10."
"778.56"," Right?"
"779.56"," So here we don't have a equal number of elements in the array."
"782.56"," Right?"
"783.56"," So in this case, if you print d dot size, what it will return?"
"786.56"," So it will just return how many number of rows are there in your array?"
"795.56"," Okay."
"796.56"," So how this size is working?"
"797.56"," It's multiplying the number of rows to the column."
"801.56"," Okay?"
"802.56"," So if I remove 9 from here, so what we have is 3 cross 3, 3 rows and 3 columns."
"809.56"," Right?"
"810.56"," So 3 cross 3 is 9."
"811.56"," So that's how it's calculating the value 9 up here."
"813.56"," If you change the value of 4 here, again 4 and again, add some value as, let's say 9."
"822.56"," Okay?"
"823.56"," So in this case, what value you will get is 4 cross 3, 4 cross 3 is 12."
"829.56"," So total number of elements in that array is 12."
"833.56"," Okay?"
"834.56"," So this is how you count the number of elements in an array."
"837.56"," Fine?"
"838.56"," Now let's just get back to our ppd and see what's left."
"842.56"," We discussed this."
"843.56"," Yeah, we all eat discussed how you can change the dimension of a array or resize it."
"850.56"," Then another example, this also we discussed."
"853.56"," Next, counting the number of elements in an array, we just did it."
"857.56"," I'm assuming all these things are clear to you, right?"
"861.56"," In case you have any doubt, feel free to reach out to us and will make sure that the"
"865.56"," doubters clear to you within 24 hours."
"867.56"," Okay?"
"868.56"," So next we have is we want to find the data type of the array."
"871.56"," So let's see how to do it."
"874.56"," So here we have is find the data type of the array."
"883.56"," Right?"
"886.56"," So let's take an example of here."
"890.56"," So let's define our array as a equal np dot arrange 24 numbers."
"898.56"," And each of data type for that I'll write d type."
"903.56"," So what's the data type?"
"905.56"," Let's say all are of float."
"907.56"," Okay?"
"908.56"," Let's check print a dot d type."
"914.56"," So it's a float."
"916.56"," Right?"
"917.56"," Now what if I just remove it?"
"920.56"," What if I just write np dot arrange 24 and print the data type for that?"
"925.56"," So here we'll get n32 values."
"928.56"," So in this case if you print the values of a you're getting 01234567910 and so on."
"934.56"," Right?"
"935.56"," And just if you change the data type using d type equal float."
"940.56"," So all you'll be getting is 0.1.1.1.1."
"944.56"," So you got a float value of here."
"946.56"," Okay?"
"947.56"," And even the data type which we're printing up here change from n32 to float 64."
"952.56"," Correct?"
"953.56"," Okay."
"954.56"," So this was all about np array inspection."
"957.56"," So in case you have any doubt feel free to reach out to us and we'll try to resolve your query within 24 hours."
"963.56"," Okay?"
