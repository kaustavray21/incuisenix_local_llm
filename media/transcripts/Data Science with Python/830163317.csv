"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome back to Python certification course."
"8.52"," In our previous session we learned about data cleaning."
"11.28"," I hope those things are clear to you guys."
"13.72"," So moving on ahead, our today session will be on manipulating the data set."
"18.0"," So in this session you will learn about how to perform indexing on the data set, how"
"22.240000000000002"," to set a value for a column, how to manipulate the data using Lambda function, how to sort"
"27.6"," a column and finally you will see how to filter your records."
"31.240000000000002"," So I hope the agenda is clear to you guys."
"33.28"," So without delaying any further, let's start with our first topic, manipulating data set"
"37.6"," indexing by position."
"39.44"," Well, what if you want to view a single column?"
"42.0"," So how will you do that?"
"43.160000000000004"," Well, Panda gives you a functionality of ILOG function in which you can specify the parameters"
"48.56"," to view a single column."
"50.400000000000006"," So for example, I want to view HP column only."
"53.52"," So my HP column belongs to 4th row."
"56.88"," Right."
"57.88"," So I mentioned their ILOG colon, which means row."
"60.92"," So entire row comma 4th column."
"64.48"," Okay."
"65.48"," So what it will give me the 4th column of the data set, which is nothing but the HP column."
"70.08"," Okay."
"71.08"," Let's move ahead."
"72.08"," Next is what if I want to view first five record of the HP column?"
"76.4"," So in it, I'll mention this is the number of row."
"79.4"," So ILOG row starting from 0 till 5."
"83.2"," Okay."
"84.2"," Actually 0 till 4 just before 5 and the column 4th."
"89.44"," So it will give me the first 5 result from the column HP."
"93.04"," Okay."
"94.04"," Next is what if I want to view all the rows and all the columns?"
"96.84"," So all you have to do is ILOG colon comma colon."
"100.28"," Okay."
"101.28"," First colon means all the rows, second column means all the column."
"104.84"," So it will give you the entire data set."
"107.0"," Next is let's see I want to see all the column from HP to curve and see all the record"
"112.12"," from index number 6."
"113.96"," So how will I do that?"
"115.36"," So for that, I have row start from 6 till the end and column start from 4 till the end."
"123.63999999999999"," So 4th column till the end and row from 6th column till the end."
"128.16"," Okay."
"129.16"," Let's move ahead."
"130.16"," So now we want to look at all the rows from the first column."
"133.35999999999999"," So again."
"134.35999999999999"," So here inside ILOG, I have mentioned colon."
"136.88"," So this represents the row."
"138.72"," So we need all the rows."
"141.36"," So for representing all the rows, we have colon."
"144.12"," Okay."
"145.12"," And the next parameter is the column number."
"147.28"," So our column number is 1."
"149.8"," So as you can see in the output, we got all the rows from our first column."
"154.28"," Okay."
"155.28"," Let's move ahead."
"156.28"," Well, you can even view your record on the base of the name of the attribute."
"160.28000000000003"," Okay."
"161.28000000000003"," So for example, I want to see all the record of MPG column."
"163.8"," So how will I do that?"
"164.88000000000002"," So instead of ILOG, first of all, I'll be using LOG over here."
"168.52"," That is location."
"169.76000000000002"," Okay."
"170.76"," So inside that row and the column."
"172.92"," So colon includes all the rows and the column is MPG."
"178.04"," So what it will give, it will give me all the rows from the MPG column."
"182.44"," Okay."
"183.44"," Next is display the record from index number zero to index six from MPG column."
"188.28"," So similarly, so lock starting from zero until six and from which column in MPG column."
"195.56"," So it gave me records from index number zero to index number six from MPG column."
"200.56"," Okay."
"201.56"," Next is to see first seven record from MPG to QSec column."
"206.2"," So here, what I'll do."
"207.72"," So inside location, what I have mentioned, the row."
"211.56"," So starting from zero till six."
"213.79999999999998"," So how many records are over there?"
"215.4"," It's like zero, one, two, three, four, five and six."
"218.44"," So in total, there are seven records and from which column?"
"221.72"," So column should start from MPG and it should enter QSec."
"226.2"," So from MPG to QSec, I need seven rows over here."
"230.35999999999999"," So this was all about how you can play with index values while manipulating your data set."
"235.04"," Okay."
"235.72"," Next is setting the value."
"237.79999999999998"," Well, if you want to set a specific value to the entire column, so you can do that easily using panda."
"243.64"," So here, cars are data frame."
"245.16"," So what we are mentioning, cars of AM."
"247.84"," So AM is what it's a column name."
"250.4"," Okay."
"251.12"," So data frame of AM equal one."
"253.51999999999998"," So what it will do, so it will assign value one to the entire column of AM."
"258.20000000000005"," So even in the output, you can see that AM has all the values of one."
"262.08000000000004"," Okay."
"262.8"," Let's move ahead."
"263.8"," Next is applying function."
"265.68"," Well, now what if I want to double my record?"
"268.08000000000004"," Well, for that, I can use lambda function over here such that X is X multiplied by two."
"273.0"," So whatever value would be there, it will just double it up."
"276.16"," So cars of AM equal cars of AM."
"278.92"," Apply F. Okay."
"280.84000000000003"," F is our function."
"282.16"," This."
"283.0"," So as you can see in the output, we got all the double records and AM."
"286.72"," Okay."
"287.52000000000004"," Next is sorting the data."
"289.76"," So what if I want to sort a column and ascending order?"
"292.36"," So for that, I have data frame dot sort underscore values and inside this, I'll mention the name of the column."
"298.08000000000004"," Okay."
"298.68"," So for example, here, my data frame is cars and the name of my column is cylinder."
"304.16"," So I'm mentioning cars dot sort underscore values by cylinder."
"308.68"," So as you can see here, my cylinder column has been sorted in ascending order."
"313.32"," Okay."
"314.04"," Next is descending order."
"316.0"," Well, all you have to do is add one more parameter over here that is ascending equal false."
"320.59999999999997"," And as you can see here, my column has been sorted in descending order."
"324.68"," Okay."
"325.44"," Next comes filtering the data."
"327.68"," Well, what if I want to view the record, which are having a more than six cylinder?"
"332.56"," So how will I do that?"
"333.71999999999997"," So for that, I have cars of cylinder is greater than six."
"337.28"," So so wherever the value of cylinder is greater than six, so we are getting a true value over there."
"342.35999999999996"," And apart from that, all our faults."
"344.59999999999997"," Okay."
"345.48"," Now what if I want to filter my records and see only the data or only the model, which"
"350.84000000000003"," are having more than six cylinders?"
"352.56"," So how will I do that?"
"353.6"," So for that, I'm storing the value into filter one."
"356.44"," And next, I'll apply a filter to my entire data frame."
"359.6"," So filtered new equal cars of filter one."
"363.0"," So what it will give me?"
"363.96000000000004"," It will give me all the true parameters from my data frame or from my filtered cars of"
"369.2"," cylinder greater than six."
"370.68"," Okay."
"371.28"," So when you view the output of filtered new, you can see that we got all the values in"
"376.0"," which the value of cylinder is greater than six."
"379.71999999999997"," Okay."
"380.32"," Next, what if I want to filter my record and check for the model, which are having six"
"385.28"," cylinder and horsepower more than 300?"
"388.0"," So for that, we added this condition over here."
"390.32"," That's it."
"391.03999999999996"," That is cars of cylinder is greater than six and cars of HP."
"395.4"," That is horsepower is greater than 300."
"397.84"," So we are using and operator over here."
"400.24"," Okay."
"401.04"," So this will give me a true result."
"402.52000000000004"," Only if both the parameters are true."
"404.72"," And again, same we are filtering the data frame and displaying the filter data."
"409.40000000000003"," So as you can see, we have only one model, meserati, borrower, which is having a horsepower"
"414.96000000000004"," of 35, which is greater than 300 and number of cylinders as eight, which is again greater"
"420.52000000000004"," than six."
"421.52000000000004"," Both our conditions are true."
"423.36"," So there's a filter data over here."
