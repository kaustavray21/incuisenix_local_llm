"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome back to Python certification course."
"8.6"," In our previous session we learned about how to import and analyze your data set."
"13.120000000000001"," Right?"
"14.120000000000001"," So I hope those things are clear to you guys."
"16.2"," So moving on ahead, our today's session will be on cleaning the data set."
"20.400000000000002"," So in this session you learn about what does meant by data cleaning and what are the"
"24.400000000000002"," various methods that you can use to clean your data."
"27.76"," So I hope the agenda is clear to you guys."
"29.76"," So without delaying any further, let's see what exactly is data cleaning."
"34.32"," So data cleaning or data cleansing is a process of detecting, correcting or removing corrupt"
"39.6"," or inaccurate records from a data set table or any database."
"44.24"," It also refers to identifying complete incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts of our data"
"49.400000000000006"," and then replacing it or modifying it."
"51.84"," This is what a data cleaning is."
"54.0"," So let's see how we can clean our data."
"56.24"," So the first thing that we can do to clean our data is we can rename the column."
"60.160000000000004"," Okay."
"61.160000000000004"," So in our data set we had a column as unnamed, right?"
"64.64"," So instead of using the column name as unnamed, we can replace it by name of the model,"
"70.4"," which represents the exact name of the column as the column contained different model of"
"75.0"," the car."
"76.0"," Right?"
"77.0"," So here what we are doing, we are renaming the column unnamed to model."
"79.92"," So as you can see here as an output, we got model up here."
"84.04"," Okay?"
"85.04"," This is the very first thing that you can do while cleaning your data."
"87.88000000000001"," You can rename the attributes."
"90.28"," Next is what if you have some null values in your data?"
"93.56"," So for treating null values, what you can do, you can fill the null values with the mean"
"97.4"," of the column and there's how we do it."
"100.0"," So cards dot Qsec."
"102.36000000000001"," So as we have analyzed in our previous session that Qsec had 29 non null records, right?"
"109.60000000000001"," So which it meant that it had three null values in it."
"113.0"," So we replaced all those null values with the mean of the Qsec column."
"117.8"," So what we did, we took the mean of the entire 29's and whatever value we got for the mean,"
"124.32"," we replaced all the null values with that particular value."
"127.84"," Okay?"
"128.84"," So replacing the missing data with the mean value will help analyzing the data in a better"
"132.64"," way."
"133.64"," Okay?"
"134.64"," So there's how we can replace the null values with the mean of the column."
"137.32"," Next is drop the unwanted column."
"139.44"," So here we can drop all those unwanted column which do not add any value in analyzing the"
"143.88"," data."
"144.88"," For example, we had serial number previously, right?"
"147.64"," But the serial number was not adding any value to our analysis part."
"151.52"," So for the further processing of the data, we can avoid or we can drop the column of serial"
"156.28"," number."
"157.28"," Okay?"
"158.28"," So how we can drop any column?"
"159.44"," So for dropping any column, what do we have to do is data frame dot drop and inside that,"
"164.88"," we have to mention the name of our column."
"167.12"," Just like this, cars equal cars dot drop and inside this columns equal, we are mentioning"
"172.72"," the name of the column as serial number and it got dropped."
"176.76"," So as you can see here in the output, we don't have the column as we used to have it previously."
"182.04"," So here serial number column is dropped."
"184.76"," Well, next is finding correlation matrix."
"188.04000000000002"," Well this correlation matrix will help you to find how a variable is correlated to other"
"193.56"," variable."
"194.56"," Because the value of correlation is high."
"196.36"," So that means the two variables are highly correlated to each other."
"200.36"," That is changing one variable by a factor of X changes other variable by a factor of Y."
"206.64000000000001"," Okay?"
"207.64000000000001"," So here as output, we got a correlation matrix, right?"
"210.32"," So from here, you can see that cylinder to cylinder."
"213.28"," It's highly correlated."
"214.32"," That is one."
"215.32"," Obviously, cylinder to displacement."
"217.72"," It is 0.9."
"219.2"," So it means that cylinder equals 0.9 times of displacement."
"224.52"," So it's like if you increase cylinder by one unit, your displacement would increase by"
"228.48000000000002"," 0.9 unit."
"230.0"," Okay?"
"231.0"," So similarly for DRAT, you can see that cylinder equal minus of 0.69 times of DRAT, which"
"237.4"," means a cylinder increases by one unit."
"240.56"," It means the value of DRAT would decrease by 0.69 units."
"244.88"," Okay?"
"245.88"," So if while finding a correlation matrix, you get a very small value of the correlation."
"250.16000000000003"," For example, let's consider this."
"252.0"," So here, correlation between carburetor and DRAT is minus of 0.09."
"257.88"," So it means they are very weakly related to each other."
"261.44"," So it's like if the carburetor is increased by one unit, so it means that if the carburetor"
"266.36"," is increased by one unit, then DRAT would decrease by 0.9 unit, which is almost very less."
"271.96"," Right?"
"272.96"," So by finding correlation matrix, you can define the correlation between the variable and"
"276.92"," from here, you can decide which attribute to choose and what not to choose while working"
"281.32"," on the problem."
"282.32"," Okay?"
"283.32"," Fine."
"284.32"," Let's move ahead."
"285.32"," Next is changing the data type."
"286.76"," Well, initially, MPG was of data type string, right?"
"291.56"," Well, MPG had some float or numerical values into it, right?"
"296.24"," But with that string, we cannot manipulate it or we cannot perform any calculation on"
"300.92"," the string data, right?"
"302.52"," So MPG has to be converted to float in order to perform some data manipulation on it."
"307.92"," So here we are converting MPG from string to float."
"311.0"," So how we can do that?"
"312.0"," So it's dataframe.mpg equal dataframe.mpg as type and inside that, we are mentioning the"
"318.48"," data type, which we want to convert to."
"320.4"," And here in this case is float."
"322.08"," Well, now if you want to see the change, you have to see cos.n4 null underscore count is"
"326.92"," equal to so from here, you can see that my MPG has been changed to floating data type,"
"332.32"," right?"
"333.32"," And even for the QC attribute, we have replaced all the null values from its mean, right?"
"338.28"," So here it's giving me 32 null values."
"340.8"," That is, now it is not having any null values on it, okay?"
"344.08"," Let's move ahead."
"346.2"," So again, we are finding the correlation."
"348.48"," This time, the MPG part is included as it has become of a floating type."
"353.08000000000004"," Remember, while calculating the correlation between two attributes, both the attributes"
"358.36"," should be numerical in nature."
"360.2"," No correlation can be found between attributes of string data type, okay?"
"365.08000000000004"," If you compare it with a previous correlation, you can see that there was no MPG value,"
"369.24"," right?"
"370.24"," Initially, the data type of MPG was string, right?"
"373.12"," Now since we have changed the data type of MPG to float over here, so next while finding"
"378.64"," the correlation, we are getting MPG value, okay?"
"381.92"," Now Python is treating it as a numerical attribute and it is using it to find the correlation,"
"387.92"," okay?"
"388.92"," So this was all about how you can clean your data set, okay?"
