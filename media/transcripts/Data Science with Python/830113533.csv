"0.0"," Well, in this session we'll learn about different types of flow control like F, LF, F4,"
"10.96"," while etc that we are going to use in Python."
"15.72"," Next is the Python flow control."
"18.04"," Well, these flow controls are the one which control the flow of execution of your program."
"28.96"," So we have six different types of flow control in Python."
"32.24"," If else nested if else for while break and continue."
"37.120000000000005"," Let's discuss them one by one starting with if else."
"41.96"," So what is this if else?"
"44.36"," Let's see its syntax."
"47.16"," If the condition is true then execute statement one else execute statement two."
"52.120000000000005"," It's as simple as that."
"53.56"," Let's see the flow of execution."
"55.36"," You started you check the condition if the condition is true then execute block one."
"60.36"," If the condition is false then go to the else part and execute block two."
"64.72"," Fine."
"65.72"," Yeah, this block one it comes under if part."
"69.52"," All right."
"70.52"," Let's move next."
"72.03999999999999"," Let's move ahead."
"73.56"," Next is nested if else."
"75.36"," Let's see the syntax."
"78.6"," If condition one is true then execute statement one else if condition two is true then execute"
"83.76"," statement true."
"84.76"," If none of them is true then execute statement three."
"88.88000000000001"," Let's check the flow control of it."
"91.60000000000001"," Start check for condition one that is if condition one is true."
"95.76"," So if condition one is true then the statement executed with the if block is executed that"
"101.24000000000001"," is execute block one."
"103.84"," If first condition is false then go and check for the second condition that is else if"
"107.92"," condition."
"108.92"," Now if else if condition is true then your second block would be executed."
"114.24"," If none of them are true then finally the else block would be executed."
"119.03999999999999"," That is execute block three."
"120.96"," And you remember one thing there is no condition associated with the else block."
"125.47999999999999"," Else block would only execute if all the evv of conditions are false."
"129.79999999999998"," Fine."
"130.79999999999998"," All right."
"132.92"," Next is the for."
"134.2"," Let's see the syntax."
"139.16"," For iterating variable in sequence."
"141.96"," Well in execute statement check."
"146.64000000000001"," Well it's the example of a program like start we are defining a variable as count equal"
"151.92000000000002"," zero."
"153.4"," Then execute statement then increment the value of count by one and then check the condition"
"159.24"," if count is less than 10 is one less than 10."
"163.20000000000002"," Yeah the condition is true."
"164.68"," So again repeat it and again execute the statement again increment the value of count"
"169.28"," by one that is count become two and again check if two is less than three and so on continue"
"175.28"," this till 10 is less than 10 and when this thing arrived that 10 is less than 10 your condition"
"181.76"," become false and you exit the loop."
"184.6"," So there is how a for looped walk."
"187.0"," Let's understand this in a better way with an example."
"189.88"," So there's our code."
"190.88"," All right."
"191.88"," We have to find a list fruits as apple banana and cherry for X in fruits."
"198.2"," And fruit of zero is apple."
"201.04"," Then print X X is what apple so apple would be printed as the output."
"207.04"," Now again what will do will again go back and check for X and fruits now X of one is banana."
"216.64"," Then print X X is what banana so it will print as banana again it will go back X and"
"224.2"," fruit of two is what cherry."
"227.51999999999998"," Print X."
"229.6"," Cherry would be printed."
"231.76"," Now if it goes back there is nothing left in the fruit so nothing would be printed."
"235.67999999999998"," All right."
"236.67999999999998"," So you got the final output as apple banana and cherry fine."
"243.51999999999998"," All right."
"245.51999999999998"," So let's move ahead next is the while."
"249.68"," The syntax for this is while condition is true then execute set of statement under"
"255.72"," the while."
"259.04"," Start check for the condition if it is true then execute block one and then again repeat"
"264.0"," the loop until the condition is true."
"266.76"," In case the condition is false then just exit the loop."
"270.68"," Let's understand this better with an example."
"273.32"," As my code like a equal one and variable part I got a equal one while a is less than"
"280.36"," five is a equal one less than five."
"284.15999999999997"," Your condition is true and what print the value of a."
"290.32"," All right."
"291.96"," So we got the output as one after getting the output increase the value of a by two."
"301.72"," So a plus equal to two that is one plus two equal three."
"307.16"," Now again go back to the loop check for the condition is three less than five."
"313.8"," Condition is true."
"316.32000000000005"," Then again go to the print a part."
"319.16"," What is a three so print a so you will get the output as three again increment the value"
"327.28000000000003"," of eight to two that is a equal five."
"330.12"," Now check the condition is five less than five."
"334.76"," No I think here we got a condition as false."
"340.84000000000003"," So we got the final output as one and three."
"344.96"," All right."
"345.96"," Let's move ahead."
"349.2"," Here's another example a equal one."
"356.36"," The variable part a equal one check the condition while a is less than three is one less than"
"362.0"," three."
"363.0"," Yeah condition is true."
"365.44"," Inside the Y part the first condition that we check if a more to equal equal zero is"
"370.2"," one more to equal equal zero."
"372.56"," Now the condition is false."
"374.72"," So I'll jump to the else part."
"377.36"," So we'll jump to the else part and print a is odd."
"383.32"," Now since the value of a currently is one."
"386.16"," So one is odd fine."
"390.36"," Then what we'll do will increment the value of a by one."
"396.40000000000003"," That is one plus one equal to fine."
"400.40000000000003"," Now again we'll go back to the Y part."
"403.40000000000003"," Now we'll check if two is less than three."
"405.8"," Yeah the condition is true fine."
"409.52000000000004"," Now what we'll do will jump to the F part and check if two more to equal equal zero."
"416.36"," Yeah the condition is true."
"417.96000000000004"," So this time we'll check if two more to equal equal zero."
"422.08000000000004"," So yeah the condition is true."
"424.36"," So what it will do it will print the F part statement that is a is even in this case was to so to is even fine."
"435.20000000000005"," So this is our output."
"437.52000000000004"," Next again it will go and increment the value of a by one."
"442.04"," So now to becomes three."
"444.96"," Again it will go back to the Y part is three less than three."
"448.44"," The condition is false."
"456.15999999999997"," So your final output is one is odd and two is even fine."
"462.2"," So this was about the wild statement."
"464.59999999999997"," Let's move ahead and learn about break."
"467.35999999999996"," So this break statement it is used to break the loop at a certain condition."
"471.91999999999996"," All right."
"473.24"," Let's understand this with the help of this flow chart."
"475.68"," Started check the condition if the condition is true then the break then check the break condition."
"482.0"," If the break condition is false then only execute block one and repeat the loop."
"487.8"," If the break condition comes to be true then break the entire loop and then exit the loop."
"493.6"," All right."
"495.6"," Let's check it with an example of here."
"499.92"," For example a equal 10 while a is greater than zero check for if a is not equal to 5."
"524.52"," Then print a else break it fine."
"551.38"," sorry"
"555.94"," judgment."
"585.94"," A minus equal to 1."
"609.62"," Let's mention it of here."
"637.14"," So we got the output as 9876."
"642.26"," So the moment loop becomes 5, we got x it out of the loop."
"646.62"," Next we have is the continuous statement."
"649.38"," Well the continuous statement won't break the loop."
"651.74"," So it will just keep the statement in case the condition is true."
"656.58"," Let's understand this with the help of this flow chart."
"659.14"," So start check for condition 1."
"661.3"," If it is true, then check for continue condition."
"665.42"," If it is false, then execute block and repeat."
"668.3399999999999"," Then in case if the condition is true, then stop executing that particular block for that"
"675.14"," particular loop and cut for that particular iteration and again go back and repeat and"
"682.06"," check the condition."
"683.62"," So this was all for this session."
"685.18"," In case you have any doubt, so you can reach out to IntelliPath 24-7 and we'll try to"
"689.78"," resolve your query ASAP."
"691.38"," Thank you."
