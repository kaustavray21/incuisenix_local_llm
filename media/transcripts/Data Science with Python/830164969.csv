"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome all to this Python certification course."
"8.56"," In our previous session we learned the basics of data visualization and Matplotlib."
"12.68"," I hope those things are clear to you."
"14.88"," Our today's session is about how to create a line plot using Matplotlib."
"18.76"," In this session you will learn about how to create a line plot, how to customize a line"
"24.080000000000002"," plot and how to create two or more plots in one figure."
"29.12"," So without delaying any further let's move on and see how to create line plot using"
"33.58"," my jippet and old book."
"36.0"," So let me just open my jippet and old book."
"38.88"," So there's my jippet and old book here what we are performing."
"42.8"," Let me just name it."
"44.24"," So we are starting with how to create a line chart or line plot."
"51.84"," So for this the very first thing that I'll be doing up here is importing my libraries."
"58.24"," I'll be importing numpy for creating my dataset."
"61.68"," So I'll import numpy as np and I'll import mark dotlib to create the visualization."
"71.4"," So import Matplotlib plot by plot as pld."
"74.84"," Okay."
"76.08"," Next I'll define a send mat plotlib."
"80.0"," L9."
"82.24000000000001"," This sets the back end of Matplotlib to align back end."
"85.08"," With this back end the output of plotting command is displayed in line within the front end."
"89.32"," Here our front end is jippet and old book and the plot will be displayed directly"
"93.24"," below the code cell that we used it."
"95.52"," The resulting plot will then be stored in a notebook document."
"98.92"," Okay."
"99.92"," Next what I need to do I need to define my dataset."
"103.03999999999999"," So here define the dataset."
"107.68"," So let's define our x coordinate let's say x equal np dot arrange numbers between 0 to"
"116.2"," 10 with a gap of 0.1."
"119.0"," Okay."
"120.0"," Next let's define y y equal let's say 2 times of x plus 5."
"126.44000000000001"," So this is the equation of y."
"128.20000000000002"," So now I have both my x coordinate and y coordinate."
"131.48000000000002"," Okay."
"132.48000000000002"," Now my next task would be to plot them on the graph."
"135.44"," So plotting the data points."
"140.12"," So for this I'll just write PLT dot plot both the coordinates x and y."
"146.07999999999998"," That's it."
"147.07999999999998"," And finally if you want to see the created visualization just write PLT dot show."
"150.68"," I'll show you the visualization that is created."
"153.44"," So there's a line plot."
"155.44"," Okay."
"156.44"," Now this is a very basic example of line plot."
"158.56"," Next let's move ahead and see how we can customize our line plot."
"161.76"," Okay."
"162.76"," Here what we are doing."
"165.6"," Customizing the line plot."
"170.04"," Okay."
"171.04"," Let's just reuse this code."
"175.23999999999998"," Now for this code you got the output as this."
"178.32"," Okay."
"179.32"," Now let's customize this line plot and change the shape of this line or add the data point"
"184.16"," on it."
"185.16"," Let's see how we can customize this line."
"187.6"," So let's start customizing it."
"189.6"," So first let's add some title x label and y label to our graph."
"194.48"," So PLT dot title."
"197.16"," So what's our title?"
"199.12"," It's a line plot demo."
"201.2"," Okay."
"203.48"," Let's name our access PLT dot x label is x axis and PLT dot y label is my y axis."
"220.16"," It's executed."
"221.16"," So here you can see that we got the title as line plot demo and our axis are labeled"
"226.92"," like x axis and y axis."
"229.6"," Here we have defined the title, the x axis and the y axis."
"233.72"," Okay."
"234.72"," Now let's try to customize our plotted line."
"237.07999999999998"," Let's see how we can customize this line."
"239.68"," Okay."
"240.68"," So let's add line width."
"243.84"," You can change the width of the line."
"245.2"," Let's say the width of the line is 2.0."
"247.2"," Okay."
"248.2"," So let's change the line style."
"250.0"," Let's say I want a dotted line."
"252.79999999999998"," So I can specify colon over here."
"255.0"," We can even choose the color."
"256.59999999999997"," So let's say my color is red."
"259.36"," So you can even control the opacity of your line using alpha value."
"263.08"," So let's say alpha equals 0.5."
"267.24"," And let's say I want to represent my data point as a circle."
"271.52"," So I'll just write over here."
"273.36"," Okay."
"274.36"," Let's execute it."
"275.36"," So we got something like this."
"277.48"," Okay."
"278.48"," So this is not much clear."
"280.24"," Let me just reduce the number of data point to make you understand a better way."
"284.04"," Let's reduce it to only 10 numbers."
"286.92"," So for 10 numbers, you got output something like this."
"291.04"," It's clear."
"292.04"," Okay."
"293.04"," You can even add a legend to it."
"294.52000000000004"," Like plot dot legend."
"297.44"," Let's say the name of legend is line 1."
"301.12"," For now, we have only one line."
"303.52000000000004"," Right?"
"304.52"," And this would be mentioned inside this square brackets on its location."
"311.12"," Let's say it should be best bet."
"314.47999999999996"," Let's execute it."
"315.96"," So you can see we got a legend up here as line one."
"319.84"," Okay."
"320.84"," So if you want, you can even add grid to your figure like PLT dot grid."
"326.28"," Make it true."
"327.52"," So the grid has added to your plot."
"329.71999999999997"," Okay."
"330.71999999999997"," So this was all about how you can customize a line plot."
"333.96"," Okay."
"334.96"," So moving on ahead, let's see how we can plot two or more plot in a same figure."
"338.79999999999995"," So this was all about customizing a line plot."
"341.44"," So now let's move where I see how to create two different plot in one single figure."
"346.2"," But before that, let's understand what is a figure."
"349.2"," So here on your screen, you can see a customized plot, right?"
"352.35999999999996"," So the area in which this customized plot is drawn or plotted is the figure."
"358.15999999999997"," You can even set the figure or you can even change the figure size."
"361.52"," So changing the figure size would change the size of the plot."
"365.08"," Let me just show you with an example."
"366.79999999999995"," So let's define the figure."
"368.56"," So figure equal plot dot figure in it."
"374.0"," Figure size is what figure sizes."
"377.59999999999997"," Let's say 10, 5."
"379.35999999999996"," So let's see what's the difference you get in the output."
"382.12"," So as you can see, changing the size of figure, change the size of the plot."
"387.2"," Okay."
"388.2"," Now let's move where and see how you can create two different plots in one single figure."
"393.32"," Okay."
"394.32"," So let's import numpy as NP."
"402.28"," Let's import my plot lab dot by plot as LT same plot lab dot in line."
"414.48"," Sorry, my plot lab in line."
"417.68"," Let's define two variables."
"420.16"," Let's say x equal NP dot arrange 0 to 10 with a equal number of 1."
"429.04"," So all the numbers between 0 and 10."
"431.28000000000003"," Let's say y1 equal 2 times of x plus 5 and y2 equal 3 times of x plus 10."
"441.72"," Okay."
"442.72"," Now to create two or more plots in a figure, we need to use a sub plot."
"451.20000000000005"," So PLT dot sub plot."
"453.68"," We'll define PLT dot sub plot with height 2 and width 1."
"458.12"," Okay."
"459.12"," And here the first plot would be active."
"461.52000000000004"," Okay."
"462.52000000000004"," So let's plot our point in it."
"463.88"," So here we are plotting the points with PLT dot plot x comma y1."
"475.92"," So there's my first graph."
"478.28"," Let's name it PLT dot title."
"482.4"," This is graph 1 and let's plot our next graph."
"487.96"," So PLT dot sub plot height 2, width 1 and here the second part would be active."
"496.2"," Again, let's plot PLT dot plot x comma y2 and let's add the title as PLT dot title."
"504.96"," Let's name it graph 2."
"507.47999999999996"," Okay."
"508.47999999999996"," So now that everything is defined."
"510.2"," So I can just call PLT dot show to see my created graph."
"514.4"," Let's execute it."
"515.92"," So I got the output as this."
"518.28"," So both my graphs are in one single visualization."
"521.4799999999999"," So if I want to display them side by side, what I have to do?"
"524.92"," I'll define the height as 1 and width as 2."
"529.1999999999999"," That's it."
"530.1999999999999"," Define the height as 1 and width as 2."
"533.28"," So you'll get the graph side by side."
"535.88"," Okay."
"536.88"," So this was all about the line chart."
"538.76"," In case you have any doubt, feel free to reach out to us."
"541.8"," So this was all about the line chart."
"543.8"," In our next session, we'll learn how to create a bar chart using MATPLOTLIVE."
"547.9599999999999"," Okay."
"548.9599999999999"," Thank you."
