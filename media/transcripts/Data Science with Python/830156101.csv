"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome back to our Python certification course. So in our last session we saw"
"10.4"," what exactly is NumPy and how you can create a NumPy array. Well in this session we are"
"15.68"," going to learn about how to initialize a NumPy array. Okay, so let's start. Well there's"
"21.6"," several methods of initializing a NumPy array. Let's discuss them one by one. So first we"
"27.4"," have is initializing array of x cross y dimension with all values as zero. So let's check back in our"
"35.32"," Jupyter notebook. So what we need to do is initialize all the elements of x cross y x cross y"
"55.4"," array to zero. Okay, let's see how to do it. So here let's import the NumPy, import NumPy as NP."
"67.56"," Now here I'll be using a function ZE-ROS, ZROS. Well this function is predefined in NumPy. This is"
"77.0"," used to initialize all the elements of an array to zero. Okay, so NP.ZE-ROS, ZROS. Inside this it"
"86.68"," takes a list of lists. So inside this what I'll pass up here is the size of my array. Let's take"
"93.72"," the size of the array as three cross four. Okay, that's it. You don't need to do anything else."
"99.16"," I mentioned the size as three cross four. It's executed. So here you got the output as three cross four"
"105.16"," matrix three cross four matrix with all the elements initialize to zero. Okay, now let's move"
"113.32"," here and see our next example. Our next example says up here is arranging the numbers between x and y"
"120.12"," within interval of z. Let's see how. So here what we have to do, arrange the numbers between x and y"
"134.68"," within interval of z. Okay, let's see how we're going to do it. Okay, import numpy as NP."
"153.24"," And the function we'll be using up here is arrange arrang. Okay, inside that we'll pass three"
"161.72"," parameter. First the starting point next the ending point and next the interval. Suppose I want"
"169.72"," the interval of two. So I'll write two up here. Okay, so here arrange the number between x and y"
"176.2"," within interval of z. So here x is one, y is ten and z is two. Fine. So let's execute it. So you got"
"185.16"," the output as one three five seven nine. So what is the output? So the output is all the numbers"
"191.0"," between one to ten with an interval of two. Okay, now let's just change these number and see"
"197.64"," what difference does it make? We want to print all the even numbers between ten and twenty."
"203.56"," So let's see how we can do it. So here we have printing even numbers between ten and twenty."
"212.6"," Okay, just to tell you you don't need to import numpy every time you're doing it. Okay, I'll just"
"218.28"," show up here. If you're not importing numpy it won't throw an error because Python is executing every"
"223.88"," statement line by line. Right. So here numpy is already executed. So I can use np up here. I'll just"
"230.68"," write np arrange inside this. It should start from ten. Right. And it should go to twenty. And"
"239.88"," the difference should be two as we are considering the even numbers. Right. So if you see the output"
"245.4"," you'll get all the numbers between ten and twenty. But the number twenty would not be included"
"250.76000000000002"," up here. So it's like ten till less than twenty. Okay, so you got the output as ten twelve fourteen"
"257.0"," sixteen and eighteen. Okay, fine. Now let's get back to our pivoting. So next we have is arranging"
"264.36"," Z number between x and y. So now our x and y values are fixed. But what we have to do up here is"
"271.96"," arrange Z numbers in between them. Okay. So here what we are going to do, arrange Z numbers"
"283.32"," between x and y. Okay, let's see how to do it. So for arranging Z numbers up here we have a"
"292.6"," function as line space. So you can call np dot line space. It's not li any. Okay, it's li n."
"304.36"," You'll make this mistake. Fine. And after that what you'll do you'll specify the first number"
"309.64000000000004"," and the ending number. That is the value of x and y. And how many numbers you want between them."
"315.8"," Suppose I want ten numbers between five and ten. So let's see what is the output."
"321.72"," So I got the output as array of ten numbers between five and ten. One, two, three, four, five, six,"
"328.68"," seven, eight, nine, ten. Okay, let's take one more example of line space up here. Now again let's"
"336.12"," sprint some even numbers like even numbers between zero to ten. Okay, so here I can write np dot"
"345.56"," line space inside this. The number should start from zero. It should go till ten. And how many"
"352.68"," numbers I want in between it's zero, two, four, six, eight and ten. Right. So how many numbers"
"361.16"," six? Okay, so let's execute it. So we got the output up here as zero, two, four, six, eight and ten."
"369.08"," Clear. So this was about the line space function and how you can arrange z numbers between two"
"375.4"," fixed values of x and y. Okay, let's get back to our ppd. So we have only discussed these examples."
"382.2"," Let's move ahead. Next example we have up here is filling same number in an array of dimension x"
"387.96"," cross y. So it's like I want to add it in which all the elements are initialized with the same"
"393.56"," number. Let's see how we can do it. So what I want to do filling same number in an array of dimension"
"408.28000000000003"," x cross y. Let's see. So again, I won't be importing numpy up here. I'll just write np dot. So for"
"418.2"," filling the same number we have a predefined function as full. It takes two parameter. First the"
"424.68"," dimension of the array and next the element you want to fill in. So suppose my dimension of the"
"430.2"," array is two cross three. Okay, and what value I want to fill in. Let's say I want to fill all"
"436.76"," the values with six. So let's execute it. As you can see, we got the output as two cross three"
"443.32"," with all the values initialized to six. Okay, let's move ahead. Next we have is filling random numbers"
"450.76"," in an array of dimension x cross y. So now what if I want to initialize my array with some random"
"456.91999999999996"," numbers. How can I do that? Well, for that you have a random function in np. Let's see how you can"
"462.84"," do it. Here we are filling some random number array of dimension x cross y. Okay, let's see how"
"483.96"," we can do it. Again, no point of importing numpy. So the numpy function I'll be using up here is"
"491.56"," I'll just write np dot random. Okay, dot random values in an array of dimension, suppose two cross"
"499.64000000000004"," three. So it will create me a two cross three array with all the random values in it. Let's see"
"505.16"," the output. So as you can see, we have a two cross three dimensional array with all the different"
"511.64000000000004"," random values. Correct. Let's move ahead. So this was all about how you can initialize a numpy array."
"518.68"," Okay."
