"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome back to Python certification course."
"8.64"," Till now we have learned about how you can import the data, how you can perform some analysis"
"13.16"," on it and how you can clean your data and how you can manipulate it."
"17.12"," Right?"
"18.12"," So I hope all those things are clear to you guys."
"20.080000000000002"," So moving on ahead, our today's session will be on visualizing the dataset or how we"
"24.560000000000002"," can create some beautiful visualization out of our data and create some insights out of"
"29.04"," it."
"29.96"," In this session you will learn about how to create a line plot, how to create an area plot"
"34.2"," and finally we'll see how to create a bar plot."
"36.28"," Don't worry, we'll deal with them in detail in our next module on Matlotlib."
"40.2"," Okay?"
"41.2"," But now I'll just give you the summary of all these plots."
"44.2"," Okay?"
"45.2"," So let's start with the line plot."
"46.6"," So here the very first thing that we have to do is import the Matlotlib library."
"50.84"," What is Matlotlib library?"
"52.2"," Well, it's a library which is generally used for creating the visualization."
"56.760000000000005"," Okay?"
"57.76"," Here we are importing the Matlotlib.py plot as PLT using a Matlotlib in line."
"63.04"," We'll see in detail what exactly it does it do in our next module."
"67.16"," And finally we are creating a line plot to see how horse power is being wired with each"
"71.67999999999999"," card."
"72.67999999999999"," Okay?"
"73.67999999999999"," So we are storing the value of horse power in the data frame Y1."
"76.32"," We have X as a range of 32 which consists of all the number between 0 till 32."
"81.96"," Okay?"
"82.96"," Well, for creating a line plot, you need to specify this plot over here."
"86.48"," And inside that mention the X and Y coordinate."
"88.8"," So we have X coordinate as range of values 0 till 32."
"93.16"," And we have Y coordinates as all the values from the HP column."
"96.96000000000001"," Okay?"
"97.96000000000001"," So this is what we'll get as a line plot."
"100.68"," Okay?"
"101.68"," So we have your range of values in the X axis and values of horse power in the Y axis."
"108.16"," Fine?"
"109.16"," Similarly here we have created a line plot between displacement and range."
"113.32000000000001"," And then what we are doing, we are combining both the plots."
"116.28"," That is the plot which we got by plotting horse power with the range of values and the displacement"
"121.32000000000001"," with the range of values."
"122.6"," So all you have to do is mention two times plot."
"125.56"," In first PLT.plot, you'll mention the X and Y1 as the X and Y coordinate."
"131.0"," And the second PLT.plot you'll mention X and Y2."
"134.48"," That is from the displacement."
"136.04"," So as our output, what you will get, you will get two different graph in one single frame."
"140.96"," Okay?"
"141.96"," So what exactly it is, we'll see in our next module on matplotlib."
"146.16"," Next is area plot."
"147.72"," So here we are creating a area plot."
"149.8"," Well area plot is nothing but what you do is while creating the line plot, you shade"
"154.4"," all the area below it till the X axis."
"157.72"," Okay?"
"158.72"," So that becomes the area plot."
"160.04"," So similarly here we had created a line plot."
"163.32"," Right?"
"164.32"," So while creating the area part, all this area, all this area is filled."
"168.32"," You can see."
"169.92000000000002"," So here the horse power is being represented by purple color."
"174.0"," And the displacement is being represented by gray color."
"177.92"," Okay?"
"178.92"," Next is area and line plot."
"180.52"," Well, you can combine both the area plot and the line plot to get a better visualization."
"185.4"," So here what you are getting, you are getting an outer boundary of the area plot over here."
"189.36"," Right?"
"190.36"," So how we are doing it?"
"191.36"," So for this, we are creating both the line plot as well as the area plot."
"194.88"," So for line plot, we are using plot and for the area plot, we have to use stack plot."
"200.2"," Okay?"
"201.2"," So this is how you can merge both area and a line plot."
"204.39999999999998"," Okay?"
"205.39999999999998"," Well, next is the bar plot."
"206.95999999999998"," For creating a bar plot, Matrotlib has a function of bar."
"210.83999999999997"," All you have to mention is X and Y coordinate."
"213.39999999999998"," And for customizing it, you can add some color, you can define it's wet, you can define"
"217.76"," the transparency, opacity and all."
"220.51999999999998"," Okay?"
"221.51999999999998"," So this is how you create a bar plot."
"224.16"," Next is to create horizontal bar plot."
"226.04"," Well, for creating a horizontal bar plot, all you need to do is replace bar by"
"231.12"," the bar edge."
"232.12"," Okay?"
"233.12"," And you will get a horizontal plot over there."
