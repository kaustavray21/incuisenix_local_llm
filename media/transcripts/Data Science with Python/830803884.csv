"0.0"," Hello everyone, welcome to this continuing session of statistics and probability. In this session,"
"10.200000000000001"," we are going to cover the concept of sampling and different sampling methods that are available"
"14.52"," per sampling. So let's quickly take a look at the agenda for this session. So we're going"
"20.0"," to start our session with the basic introduction to sampling and then we are going to understand"
"24.240000000000002"," the difference between Pollation and Sample. And in the end, we are going to discuss various"
"29.4"," probability based and non-probability based sampling techniques with examples. So let's go ahead"
"35.8"," and start with the introduction to sampling. So what exactly is sampling? Sampling is a technique"
"43.0"," in which a small subset from a very large set of data is taken for analysis or for performing"
"49.04"," statistical tests. Now on these samples, we can draw conclusions based on our analysis and"
"55.8"," deduce the same for the entire data as well. This kind of sampling method saves a lot of"
"61.879999999999995"," computation time since the entire data is converted into smaller samples. To understand this better,"
"68.36"," let's take a look at what exactly is population and what does it mean to get a sample from our"
"73.56"," population. To understand the difference between sample and a population, let us consider an example."
"80.52"," So let's suppose there is an organization with thousands of software engineers. Now the sample"
"85.96"," from the population will be a small set of individuals who are working in the organization."
"91.16"," It could be 30 individuals, it could be 50 individuals and so on. But the entire workforce in"
"96.75999999999999"," the organization consisting software engineers will be called the population. And we can perform"
"102.6"," various statistical tests to draw consistent conclusions about the entire workforce. But to"
"109.64"," know how we have sampled the entire sample with those 30 to 15 individuals, we must understand"
"115.48"," various sampling techniques that can be used to sample the data for big populations. So let's go"
"121.88"," ahead and understand the various sampling techniques. The types of sampling can be divided into two groups,"
"128.84"," probability based sampling and non-probability based sampling techniques. Here we have four four"
"136.44000000000003"," sampling techniques for each probability and non-probability based sampling and we'll be covering them"
"140.44000000000003"," in the session. So first of all, let's talk about probability based sampling. So the probability"
"146.44000000000003"," based sampling is a random and it presents strong statistical findings. On the other hand,"
"153.64000000000001"," non-probability based sampling takes sample observations in a not-so-random manner."
"158.76000000000002"," It is rather motivated based on convenience and other criteria that we will learn about in the"
"164.12"," next section. Now let's go ahead and learn about the probability based sampling techniques."
"169.64000000000001"," The first one that we have is simple random sampling. In simple random sampling method or technique,"
"176.36"," it is easier to understand or we can say it is the easiest to understand among all the"
"181.16"," sampling techniques. In this technique, the probability of an observation from the population is"
"187.24"," the same in order to make it to the sample. For example, if we take the same organization from"
"193.32"," the example that we have discussed over here, if we were to make a sample of 20 individuals from"
"200.35999999999999"," the population, the chance of an individual from the pool of thousand individuals is going to be"
"205.4"," equal for everyone. Meaning, every individual has an equal chance of making it to the sample."
"212.44"," Since the entire process is going to be random and this is it for simple random sampling. Next"
"219.16"," of we have systematic sampling and in this technique, it is quite similar to simple random"
"225.4"," sampling again, but there is just one catch. So we have specific intervals that are decided for"
"232.68"," the entire population and the individuals are paid from those specific intervals only."
"238.35999999999999"," For example, if we were to get 20 individuals for the sample, we will create an interval of let's"
"243.64000000000001"," say after 15 individuals. So after every 15 individuals in the pool, the individual will be picked"
"249.96"," for the sample. It is similar to random sampling in a way where the intervals can be random."
"255.48000000000002"," Therefore, an element of randomness is always going to be there in the sample."
"260.76"," Next up, we have stratified sampling. In stratified sampling, the entire population is divided"
"267.0"," into subcategories and the final sample is taken from each of the categories. For example,"
"273.4"," we will create subcategories based on years of experience for the individuals in the organization."
"278.44"," Now, based on these categories, let's suppose we have taken experience level from 0, 1, 2, 3,"
"284.59999999999997"," until 5, 5 years and so on. So we will pick individuals at random from each of these categories"
"290.76"," to make up the sample of 20 individuals. So that is how stratified sampling technique works."
"296.2"," And next up, we have cluster sampling. This one is a little trickier to understand. In the cluster"
"302.92"," sampling, we do create subcategories, but each of the subcategories will have a similar attribute"
"309.40000000000003"," with respect to the entire population. Now, instead of choosing individuals from each category,"
"315.24"," the entire subcategories chosen as a sample. So this type of sampling can create some sort of"
"321.32"," sampling bias and cannot represent an entire population. For example, we will create subcategories"
"329.08"," of individuals that work in IT sectors, but the employer for all those individuals in those subcategories"
"334.59999999999997"," will be similar, which is kind of a similar attribute for all the individuals in the population."
"340.12"," And then choose any of the subcategories at random to be our entire sample for the population."
"346.68"," I hope this is clear to you guys. And now that we are done with probability based sampling methods,"
"351.64"," let's learn about the non-probability based sampling as well."
"355.48"," So in non-probability sampling method, the first one that we have is convenience sampling."
"360.92"," Convenience sampling are highly prone to selection bias and sampling bias."
"367.16"," And because there is no randomness while selecting the observations for the sample,"
"370.84000000000003"," that is why it has bias in it. It is called convenience sampling because the samples are formed"
"377.32000000000005"," quite conveniently. For example, let's say if we have to create a sample of 20 individuals from"
"383.8"," the entire population of 1000 individuals from the organization, we will just pick the first 20 individuals"
"389.4"," that we can get our hands on. So that is how convenience sampling works because it is convenient."
"394.59999999999997"," I'll just pick up 20 individuals or the observations for my sample. And that is how convenience"
"400.03999999999996"," sampling works. Next up, we have a purpose of sampling. In purpose of sampling, the sample"
"406.84"," observations are taken out. After an expert provides a useful insight about the sample that must"
"412.68"," be collected. For example, there is a stakeholder or the expert in this matter who is going to"
"420.2"," inform the analyst to only choose the individuals between the age of 18 to 20 because that is what the"
"425.8"," sample needs to be for the analysis or the survey. And all those sample observations will be drawn"
"432.44"," according to the input given by the stakeholder. So that is how purpose of sampling works."
"438.04"," And next up, we have snowball sampling. This is also a little bit tricky when it comes to"
"443.96000000000004"," understanding. So when it comes to snowball sampling, the access to the exact observations"
"449.64"," that are required might not be present in the sample. For example, if we want to conduct a survey"
"456.2"," on school going students under the age of 12, but the population only consists of individuals"
"462.03999999999996"," who may or may not have children. In this case, what we are going to do is we will rely on the"
"468.03999999999996"," information collected from the individuals from the sample. And the sample will have individuals"
"474.28"," who might or might not have kids below the age of 18 or in this case below the age of 12, sorry,"
"479.56"," about that repeat below the age of 12. And that is why it is called snowball sampling because"
"486.2"," we snowballed to a sample observations from one sample to another. And last but not the least,"
"491.64"," we have quota sampling. And in this type of non-probably based sampling, we have to keep the"
"498.84"," similar population attributes in the sample as well. To understand this, let's take a small example."
"507.0"," So let's suppose our population has 40% or in this case, we have population consisting of 50%"
"515.16"," individuals between the age of 18 to 25. So this means that in quota sample, sample will also have"
"521.64"," the same percentage of individuals having ages between 18 to 25. Let's take another example."
"526.8399999999999"," For example, let's suppose that our population has 40% of females and 60% of males in the"
"534.76"," entire population. So when I'm making a quota sample or when I'm doing a quota sampling technique,"
"540.36"," the same proportion of males and females are going to be present as well in the sample,"
"546.84"," which is in a sample of 20 individuals, if I'm taking for this population, 12 males,"
"552.6800000000001"," which are going to be the 60% of the entire sample and 8 females, which is going to be 40% of the"
"558.2"," entire sample are going to be present according to the quota sampling."
"564.6800000000001"," And with this, we have come to the end of the session for sampling techniques."
"568.92"," And now that we have learned about sampling techniques, we will move on to learn about"
"572.76"," probability and how it helps in data science. More of that, we are going to cover in the next"
"577.72"," section. Thank you guys. Thanks for watching."
