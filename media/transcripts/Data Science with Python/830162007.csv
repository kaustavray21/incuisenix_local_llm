"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome back to Python certification course."
"8.52"," In our previous session, we learned about data frame."
"11.08"," We saw various topics like what is data frame and how does it work."
"15.84"," Right?"
"16.84"," So moving on ahead, our today's session will be on merge join and concatenate operations"
"21.28"," that can be done on the data frame."
"23.56"," So today you will see how you can perform merge operation on two different data frames"
"28.16"," using pandas."
"29.6"," How you can perform join operation between them and how you can perform concatenation"
"34.36"," between them."
"35.36"," Okay?"
"36.36"," So I hope the agenda is cleared you guys."
"38.36"," So without delaying any further, let me just switch back to my Jupyter notebook and"
"41.760000000000005"," let me show you how you can perform these operations."
"45.04"," So here's my Jupyter notebook."
"46.52"," The way we left it in our last session."
"48.52"," So today what we are going to do, today we are going to see how to perform merge operation"
"58.76"," between two data frame."
"60.44"," Okay?"
"61.44"," So for this, the very first thing that I need to do is create my data frames."
"66.84"," So first of all, let's import the libraries."
"69.6"," So import pandas as PD."
"72.28"," I'll be needing this library only."
"74.8"," And now let me just define two data frames."
"77.12"," Now once I have imported the library, so next thing I'll do is define few less over here."
"82.4"," So let's say player equal, player one, player two and player three."
"89.60000000000001"," Okay?"
"90.60000000000001"," Next let's define a list of points."
"93.16000000000001"," So point equal, let's say eight, nine, six."
"98.80000000000001"," Okay?"
"99.80000000000001"," Let's also add a list of title to it."
"102.36000000000001"," So title equal game one, game two and game three."
"112.12"," So now that I have defined three list over here, I need to create a data frame out of it."
"116.24000000000001"," So let's say my first data frame equal PD dot data frame."
"122.88000000000001"," And inside this, let's create a dictionary."
"125.48"," Let's add a label, let's say, player and this player contains all the values from my list"
"132.08"," of player."
"133.08"," Okay?"
"134.08"," Come points."
"137.92"," And this points consist of all the values from the point list and the title."
"144.23999999999998"," The title which consists of all the values from the title list."
"148.48"," So I've created my data frame over here."
"151.04"," So let's just print it."
"153.07999999999998"," So this is my data frame, which I just created."
"155.92"," So one of the data frame is ready."
"157.79999999999998"," Now let's define another data frame for this will be needing different list."
"162.6"," So let's say here player equal player one player five and player six."
"172.44"," Let's define another list as bar."
"174.84"," So par equal punch kick and album."
"180.68"," Fine."
"181.68"," Next I'll define a list of title."
"183.6"," So here title equal."
"186.28"," Players from the game one next is this one from the let's say game five and this one"
"193.4"," from game six."
"195.6"," Okay?"
"196.6"," Here all our list are ready."
"198.88"," Now let's create a data frame for it."
"200.68"," So here DF2 that is second data frame equal PD dot data frame."
"207.28"," So inside this, let's define a dictionary."
"209.36"," Say column name is player, which consists of the values from player list."
"214.48"," Next is par."
"216.0"," So my next column is which consists of the values from par list and the next is title."
"222.4"," Now again, which consists of the values from title list."
"225.64"," So there's my second data frame."
"227.28"," Let me just print it."
"228.48"," So here my second data frame is also ready."
"231.0"," So this one is my first data frame and this one is my second data frame."
"234.72"," So now that our data frame is ready."
"236.52"," So the very first thing I'll be performing on it is in a merge."
"241.72"," So what exactly is this in a merge?"
"243.72"," Well, the result of this inner merge would be that if I'll return you the row, which"
"248.56"," is common in both the data frame on the base of any key value."
"252.0"," So let's have a look at our data frames."
"254.44"," Any common value over here, like any common column, you can say."
"259.16"," So we have player and title in both our data frame, right?"
"261.96"," So we can perform the inner merge using any of these two column with a player or title."
"267.32"," Let me show you how."
"268.6"," So let's say I want to merge my data frame one with data frame two."
"272.16"," So I'll write data frame one dot merge merge with what data frame two."
"277.84000000000003"," Okay."
"278.84000000000003"," And on the base of what you have to specify your key value over here."
"283.88000000000005"," So on let's say I want on the base of title."
"288.88"," Okay."
"289.88"," And how I want to merge them."
"292.08000000000004"," So how equals enough so this will give you the inner join."
"296.04"," So we got this result over here."
"297.88"," So here player underscore X represents that this attribute is from data frame."
"302.16"," One and player underscore why represents that this attribute is from the data frame two."
"307.0"," Okay."
"308.0"," So why did we got just one value over here?"
"310.2"," Let's explore it."
"311.64"," So on the base of title."
"313.48"," So we are merging on the base of title."
"315.52"," So what are the common values in it as an merge gave you the common set of values in both"
"320.68"," the data frame on the base of what attribute you are choosing."
"325.0"," So as we have chosen title over here."
"327.6"," So common attributes game one."
"330.04"," Only game one is common right."
"331.84"," So whatever values are associated with game one you got that."
"335.76"," Okay."
"336.76"," If I change the value of title to player."
"339.23999999999995"," Let's see what's the difference."
"342.23999999999995"," So here I got the value of player one as player one was only common in both the data frame."
"347.84"," Right."
"348.84"," So here player did not get split into player underscore X or player underscore Y."
"352.71999999999997"," So instead of that title got split it up to title underscore X and title underscore Y."
"358.52"," Okay."
"359.52"," So title underscore X is game one and title underscore Y is also game one."
"366.24"," So there's how we perform a inner join on two data frame."
"369.4"," So just to tell you by default if you merge two data frame it will perform a inner join."
"375.59999999999997"," Okay."
"376.59999999999997"," See."
"377.59999999999997"," So this was all about inner merge."
"379.03999999999996"," Now let's move ahead and see how you can perform left merge."
"386.56"," So even performing left merges quite similar to the one which you perform an inner merge."
"391.72"," Just have to write data frame one dot merge."
"397.0"," Data frame two on player and instead of this inner you have to mention left that's it."
"404.28"," So in case of left merge both of the table would be merged together."
"408.48"," But in this case all the values from table one would be there."
"413.24"," So our table one has or the data frame one has player one player two and player three."
"419.52"," Right."
"420.52"," So all these values are over here and apart from it what else you will get you will get all"
"425.88"," the values from second data frame and here you will get all the common values from your"
"430.6"," second data frame."
"431.68"," So here my player one was in both the data frame right."
"434.40000000000003"," So it merged both the table and it showed me these values over here punch and game one."
"439.32"," Right."
"440.32"," So here two and player three they were not in the second data frame right."
"443.84"," So that's why panda was not able to identify what value should it give in power and title."
"449.8"," So that is why it mentioned NAN over here."
"452.88"," Okay."
"453.88"," So this is how you perform a left merge."
"456.32"," Now next let's see how to do a right merge."
"460.92"," So again you don't have to do anything just change left to right."
"466.48"," So left becomes right."
"468.48"," So you got this value."
"469.92"," So I'm getting this value similar to left merge."
"473.12"," Now it's performing right merge."
"474.44"," So all the values from your right table would be here."
"477.40000000000003"," Okay."
"478.40000000000003"," So player one five six."
"479.64000000000004"," I'm getting all the values from my right table or right data frame or second data frame."
"484.92"," Right."
"485.92"," So one five six hour over here one five six punch kick elbow and game one game five and"
"491.12"," game six and apart from it what are the common values from the left data frame right."
"496.2"," So from our first data frame we got this value as player one was common in both of them."
"501.36"," Correct."
"502.36"," And apart from it we didn't have any value for player five or player six."
"506.0"," That is why we got NAN NAN NAN NAN NAN NAN values over here."
"511.15999999999997"," So this was about the right merge."
"513.4399999999999"," Now next is how to perform a out of merge."
"517.04"," Let's see."
"519.2"," Out of merge."
"520.36"," So here all you have to do is change this to out of executed."
"524.84"," So in this case you will get all the values and wherever the value is not common you will"
"529.72"," get NAN over there."
"531.1600000000001"," Okay."
"532.1600000000001"," So this was about the out of merge."
"534.24"," So guys this was all about the merge."
"536.32"," Now next let's move ahead and learn about the joint operation using panda."
"540.44"," There's a slight difference between the merge and join in case of panda."
"543.9200000000001"," Let me tell you what in case of merge the two data frames we're getting merged on the"
"548.5600000000001"," base of their attribute name or the column name."
"551.08"," Right."
"552.08"," It's that both the data frame must contain at least one common at attribute name."
"557.32"," Right."
"558.32"," But this is not the case in join."
"560.32"," It's a bit different in case of join the two data frames are joined on the base of their"
"565.2800000000001"," index value."
"566.76"," Join is generally used when two tables have completely different attributes and this is"
"571.08"," the reason why you have to specify the set index well performing join."
"575.48"," Okay."
"576.48"," So you can say that it's must to have a common index between the data frames."
"582.04"," Okay."
"583.04"," So let's move ahead and let me just show you how you can perform join operation."
"587.84"," So here how to perform join operation in pandas."
"598.6"," So similarly the very first thing that we need to do is define our data frame."
"602.2"," So let's just copy the one which we already created."
"606.48"," So here I need to make some changes in it."
"609.48"," What change here have to add index value for it."
"613.32"," So let's say index equal 11 L2 and L3 as this is my left data frame."
"622.1600000000001"," Okay."
"623.6800000000001"," And let's define our fourth data frame."
"627.1600000000001"," And this let's change the name of the attributes."
"630.0"," So here let's make players and titles and also let's change the index number."
"635.52"," So let's say we have L2 L3 and L4."
"640.96"," Okay."
"641.96"," So our data frames are ready."
"644.48"," Here I'll be performing the join function."
"646.92"," So first let's perform inner join on it."
"649.6"," Well the concept of inner join and inner merge everything is same."
"654.08"," Okay."
"655.08"," The difference is how it is used in case of join the two data frames are joined on the"
"660.24"," base of their index name in case of merge two data frames are merged on the base of"
"665.0"," their attribute name."
"666.44"," It's the only difference."
"667.6800000000001"," Okay."
"668.6800000000001"," And it's same with inner join left join right join out to join everything."
"672.9200000000001"," Now let's see how to perform our inner join."
"675.2"," So I want to join my data frame three with data frame four."
"680.0400000000001"," Okay."
"681.0400000000001"," We have to change it."
"682.0400000000001"," Let's name it four four."
"684.64"," So I need to join data frame three with data frame four."
"687.6"," So DF three dot join inside this data frame four and how I want to join."
"695.08"," So how equal I want to perform inner join between them."
"698.64"," That's it."
"699.64"," Execute it."
"700.64"," Okay."
"701.64"," We are getting error of columns overlap."
"703.0"," Okay."
"704.0"," I guess we missed one value over here."
"707.1999999999999"," Okay."
"708.1999999999999"," Now both our tables are also different."
"714.76"," Now let's perform inner join on it."
"716.9599999999999"," So while performing inner join you can see that it has joined both the tables on the base"
"721.8399999999999"," of their common index name."
"724.8"," Right."
"725.8"," So L two and L three L two and L three are common part over here."
"730.4"," So that's why we got these values."
"732.8"," So this player is from the left data frame and this players is from the right data frame."
"737.56"," Fine."
"738.56"," So this was about the inner join."
"740.68"," Now let's change it to left join."
"742.84"," So left join."
"745.08"," Let's copy it and just change inner to left."
"750.84"," That's it."
"752.32"," So here you can see that we are getting some null values over here."
"755.1600000000001"," So why we are getting null values over here."
"757.52"," So it's the same reason what happened in case of merge."
"760.0400000000001"," So in case of left join it is merging both the data frame with all the data from the"
"766.2800000000001"," left data frame and all the common data from the right data frame."
"772.0"," Right."
"773.0"," And wherever the data and right data frame does not match that to the left one."
"777.96"," So there we are getting a null value."
"780.16"," Okay."
"781.16"," Similarly right join."
"784.08"," How right."
"786.48"," And this we are getting all the values from our right data frame and all the common values"
"791.52"," from the left data frame."
"793.84"," Fine."
"795.32"," Next is outer join."
"798.52"," That's right outer over here."
"801.96"," So what it did it just merged both the data frames."
"806.1999999999999"," Wherever it was not able to find the common values it assigned null values to it."
"811.48"," Okay."
"812.48"," So this was all about join."
"815.0799999999999"," Now next we'll see how to perform concatenation using pandas."
"819.84"," So here we'll write out to concatenate two data frames in panda."
"832.32"," So we already have defined data frame three and data frame four right three and four."
"836.84"," So let's just concatenate them."
"838.84"," So for concatenating data frame three with data frame four all we need to do is PD dot"
"845.68"," PD dot concat and inside it mentioned what all data frame you want to concatenate."
"852.64"," So here data frame three with data frame four that's it executed."
"861.3199999999999"," So you got this value over here."
"863.3199999999999"," Okay."
"864.3199999999999"," So it is basically concatenating both the data frames."
"867.12"," Okay."
