"0.0"," Hello everyone. Welcome to this self-paced session on statistics and probability in data"
"11.040000000000001"," signs. In this session we will cover the basics of data and various types of data. So let's"
"16.92"," go ahead and take a look at the agenda for this session. So we are going to start with"
"20.48"," the introduction to data and then we will move on to various types of data. After a quick"
"24.96"," difference between qualitative and quantitative data, we will cover the various types of data"
"29.64"," such as discrete continuous, categorical and ordinal data with examples. I hope the"
"35.4"," agenda is clear to you guys. So let's go ahead and start the session. Data is nothing but"
"40.8"," any information that can be translated into useful information. The data can be collected"
"47.08"," through various sources and accumulated in different formats. The analysis and statistical"
"52.68"," methods are used to make sense of unstructured and structured data together useful actionable"
"58.6"," insights for decision making in domains such as healthcare, policy making, sports, finance,"
"64.92"," etc. And now that we have a slight area about what data is, let's go ahead and understand"
"70.64"," the various types of data that is available to us. There are mainly two types or categories"
"76.4"," of data. There are two types or categories of data that can be translated into information,"
"82.32"," qualitative and quantitative data. So when we talk about qualitative data, it is the"
"87.52"," kind of data where we cannot express the measure of the information in terms of numbers."
"93.64"," Qualitative data expresses the quality of certain features, for example, the data collected"
"98.6"," through questionnaires, surveys and similar sources gives the qualitative perspective of"
"104.75999999999999"," information like what is the qualification of a student, how many schools did one person"
"110.08"," change during their educational life, etc. Moving on to quantitative data, this type of"
"116.24"," data gives the exact information in terms of quantity. A simple example would be, what"
"121.75999999999999"," was the revenue for the third quarter of a FinTech company, what was the average temperature"
"126.52"," in the month of January for the city of New York, etc. To understand the difference between"
"131.96"," the two, let's take a look at some of the key points that can help you differentiate"
"136.24"," between qualitative and quantitative data. The very first distinguishing point is that"
"143.04"," qualitative data will describe the quality of the information and the quantitative data"
"148.28"," will describe the quantity. After that, we can distinguish between qualitative and quantitative"
"154.48"," based on how the data is collected. In qualitative data, the information often is categorized"
"160.72"," into various categories and for qualitative data, the information is gathered based on"
"166.48"," numerical significance as discussed in the examples in the previous section. Another distinguishing"
"172.32"," characteristic would be to just observe, let's say in an event, if the information gives"
"177.88"," answers to why and how often event, it is qualitative in nature. As for quantitative data,"
"184.95999999999998"," the event answers the information in terms of how many. The next difference is qualitative"
"191.68"," data is subjective in nature and contains unique information while quantitative data describes"
"198.68"," a fixed information. Last but not least, the analysis of qualitative data is done by"
"205.72"," grouping the data into categories while quantitative data is analyzed through statistical tests"
"211.20000000000002"," and measures. The types of data are further divided into discrete, continuous, categorical"
"217.44"," and ordinal data, so let's take a look at each of them one by one with examples."
"222.96"," The data is a type of quantitative data that contains finite information which is countable"
"229.44"," and non-negative in nature. Only a limited number of values are possible in a discrete data."
"235.20000000000002"," The most common example would be how many students are present in a class that only teaches"
"240.32"," mathematics. There can only be a finite number of students that will be present in the class"
"245.44"," and cannot be further subdivided into categories. Another example would be the number of companies"
"251.56"," that sell healthcare products in a state or a customer purchasing information in the last quarter,"
"257.96"," etc. And now that we are done with discrete data, let's take a look at what is continuous data."
"265.56"," Continuous data on the other hand is the complete opposite of the discrete data. In this type of"
"271.08"," data any numerical infinite value can be present in the given range. For example, the daily average"
"277.56"," temperature of the city or the revenue of a company over the last three quarters or another example"
"283.48"," could be the measure of height for the adult males over the age of 25. And now that we are done"
"289.4"," with continuous data, let's take a look at categorical data. The categorical data is simple to"
"296.76"," understand. It is qualitative in nature for fall and it contains data that is classified into"
"303.0"," categories. These categories can be binary or nominal in nature. For example, gender of a person,"
"311.0"," educational qualifications, species of a virus mutation, etc. The significance is that there will be"
"318.52"," a finite categories in which the data can be categorized. And now that we are done with categorical"
"323.96"," data, let's take a look at ordinal data as well. Ordinal data despite being qualitative data"
"330.76"," has some numerical significance. Although there are numerical categories involved, the data is still"
"336.92"," going to be confined in a categorical state. A simple example would be the world rankings of"
"342.84"," about players or the data that describes the shoe size of an individual in a given standard unit"
"349.0"," to be. In a given standard unit of measurement, it will always fall in certain categories that will"
"356.28"," also be numerical in nature. So that's all for data and different types of data guys. The significance"
"363.4"," of learning different data types is to understand how our analysis is going to be orchestrated"
"368.67999999999995"," since different types of data has specific properties and the statistical analysis"
"373.47999999999996"," uncovers insights in the most efficient way. If the data presented is aligning with the statistical"
"381.08"," method that is being used. For example, if we have to perform an AD fuller test of stationarity,"
"386.59999999999997"," we must make sure we present the time series data for the test in order to get efficient results."
"392.12"," Another example would be a chi-square test of independence which only works with categorical features."
"398.44"," And more of this on in the upcoming sessions guys, thank you for watching and keep learning."
