"0.0"," So in this session we'll start with the basic of Python, where we'll be learning like"
"9.48"," what is Python, who invented Python and why did it name it so."
"13.88"," I will also tell you about why you should learn Python and what are the popular companies"
"17.88"," and tech giants in the market were already used again."
"20.72"," So without delaying any further, let's start this session."
"25.12"," Let me start this session with some facts and research based on Python."
"29.84"," According to Stack Overflows 2018 developer survey, it was found that Python is the most"
"34.76"," wanted programming language of 2018."
"38.36"," Even if you talk about the career in Python, Python developers are in a great demand for"
"42.68"," a wide range of jobs all over the world."
"45.44"," These include machine learning, databases, data analysis, cloud infrastructures, website"

"64.56"," you'll find thousands of job opportunities out there."
"68.4"," Based on Indeed's March 2018 data, the average salary of a Python developer in US was around"
"75.0"," $115,835."
"79.2"," Such high average salary in the case that many companies are competing to hire knowledgeable"
"83.56"," Python developers."
"85.36"," And it also supports the fact that Python is an in-demand skill."
"89.44"," Okay, so let's start our session with introduction to Python."
"93.68"," So what is Python?"
"95.28"," Well, Python is a high level object oriented programming language for general purpose"
"99.88"," programming."
"101.12"," It is one of the most widely used high level programming language and is well known for"
"105.16"," executing basic tasks with less code, which makes it more compact and an economical language"
"111.0"," to learn."
"112.36"," If you see, Python code is often 3 to 5 times shorter than the Java codes and around"
"117.88"," 5 to 10 times shorter than C++ codes."
"121.6"," Well, if you talk about its history, it was developed by Guadu Van Rozom in the year"
"127.08"," 1991 and since then its open source community is still growing."
"132.36"," So how do you think he came up with this name?"
"134.76"," Wasn't because of a snake?"
"136.36"," Well, no."
"137.60000000000002"," Rozom named Python over the name of a sitcom TV series Monty's Python flying circus."

"158.48000000000002"," So the first point we have is simple and easy to learn."
"161.84"," Well, if you compare Python with any other language, for example, Java or C++, you"
"167.32"," will find that its syntax is way lot easier than them."
"170.68"," You don't have to worry about the missing semi-commas in the end and its syntax is more"
"174.76"," readable and you are safe from writing multiple lines of code just for printing a statement"
"179.6"," like in case of Java."
"182.32"," If you talk about Python, all you need to write is just one line of statement, for example"
"186.51999999999998"," print and within the double quotes mentioned whatever you want to print."
"190.64"," So there's how it is simple and easy to learn."
"193.64"," The next point comes the career opportunity."
