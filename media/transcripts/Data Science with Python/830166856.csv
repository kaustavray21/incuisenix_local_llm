"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome all to this Python certification course."
"8.120000000000001"," In our previous session we learned about box plot and violin plot."
"11.08"," I hope those things are clear to you."
"12.92"," Our today's session is on how to create a pie chart."
"15.96"," So in this session you'll learn about how to create a pie chart, how to customize a pie"
"20.16"," chart and finally how to create a donut chart."
"23.72"," Without deling any further let's quickly jump back to our Jupyter Notebook and see"
"27.72"," how to create a pie chart using Matplotlib."
"30.8"," There's my Jupyter Notebook and today we'll see how to create a pie chart."
"35.24"," How to create a pie chart."
"40.120000000000005"," The very first thing that I'll be doing up here is importing my required libraries."
"44.519999999999996"," So importing required libraries."
"50.6"," For this I'll be importing Matplotlib for creating the visualizations."
"54.4"," So Matplotlib.pyplot as PLT."
"60.08"," Let's inline our visualization with our cell."
"64.2"," Matplotlib inline."
"67.28"," Now let's define our data."
"69.64"," Let me just prepare my dataset."
"71.52"," So you're preparing the dataset."
"74.4"," Let's see I have a list of labels as dogcat wolf and align."
"85.24000000000001"," Now let's define their size."
"87.16000000000001"," So let's take a list of size."
"89.52000000000001"," So size is equal."
"91.68"," Let's say 50 dog is 50 so cat is relatively smaller."
"95.80000000000001"," Let's take it 45 wolf make it 60."
"99.0"," Let's make line as 7580."
"101.24000000000001"," Let's take 80."
"103.08000000000001"," Now our dataset is also defined."
"105.24000000000001"," Now let's create a plot creating the pie chart."
"110.8"," For this all I want to do is PLT.py inside this and define sizes."
"117.8"," I'm a labels equal labels just for the clarification."
"122.6"," Let me just rename this label as label."
"125.64"," So here labels equal label."
"127.28"," That's it."
"128.28"," Let's add a title to it."
"130.04"," PLT.tittle.py chart demo."
"133.88"," Finally let's visualize it."
"135.32"," So PLT.show."
"136.72"," That's it."
"137.56"," It's executed."
"138.6"," So here I got my pie chart."
"140.72"," Now let's customize our pie chart a bit."
"143.48"," As a part of customization I can add percentage to it."
"147.16"," I can add shadow."
"148.28"," I can define the start angle or I can even define the birth size."
"152.68"," So for defining the percentage we have a parameter as auto."
"156.48"," PCD equal percentage 1.1."
"160.16"," Air."
"161.68"," OK."
"162.28"," Now I want to add some shadow."
"163.96"," So shadow equal through and also we can define a start angle."
"170.72"," Start angle is 90 degree."
"174.4"," So now we have learned how to create a pie chart and how to customize it."
"178.28"," A third topic is how to create a donut chart."
"181.36"," Let's do it."
"182.84"," How to create a donut chart."
"188.96"," Here let's start by importing our libraries."
"192.48"," Import matplotlib.pyplot as PLT."
"198.6"," Next let's align it."
"200.76"," So percentage matplotlib.nline."
"205.2"," Next let's define our data set."
"208.88"," So let's say we have group names as group A, group B and group C."
"220.0"," Let's define their size."
"221.4"," So group numbers go size equal 2040."
"228.0"," Let's change it to 2030 and 50."
"234.32"," Now for creating a donut chart we are needing two different pie charts."
"237.64"," And one that would be at the center and would be a white color."
"241.16"," So let's define size for our center."
"245.68"," Let's take any random value."
"247.28"," Let's take it find."
"248.56"," Let's create our donut chart."
"251.8"," So here let's say my by 1 equal PLT.py inside this the size is group underscore size."
"262.52000000000004"," Let's define the labels."
"264.12"," Labels is group underscore names."
"268.44"," Let's define radius as 1.5."
"271.92"," So now in order to get our center circle what we have to do."
"274.88"," So we have to create a pie chart without any dissection and its color should be white"
"279.52"," and the radius should be less than that of 5."
"282.59999999999997"," So pie 2 equal PLT.py inside this size radius."
"289.15999999999997"," Let's make it 1.0 and also the color color equal W."
"295.35999999999996"," W4 white and let's execute it and see what we are getting."
"299.24"," So we got the output as this."
"301.47999999999996"," So there's our donut chart."
"303.15999999999997"," So there's our output."
"304.8"," So if you want to customize your donut chart you can add shadows or change the color of"
"309.44"," these pies."
"310.76"," Let me just show you how for this."
"312.6"," Let me just define the color."
"313.8"," Let's say a comma b comma c equal lot dot CM dot blues plot dot CM dot reds and plot"
"324.68"," dot CM dot green."
"328.56"," Now that we are defined a value."
"330.52"," So here let's add another parameter as colors equal a of 0.5."
"337.84"," B of 1.5 and C of let's say 1.0."
"342.52"," Let's execute it."
"343.71999999999997"," So the color of the pie has been changed to red, blue and green of respective shade."
"349.35999999999996"," These 0.5 1.5 and 1.0 are present the respective shades of blue, red and green."
"356.08"," This was all about how to create a donut chart."
"358.76"," And our next session we'll see how to create an area plot."
