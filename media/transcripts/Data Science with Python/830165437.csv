"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome all to this Python certification course."
"8.28"," In our previous session we learned about how to create a line plot."
"12.64"," So our today's session is about how to create a bar plot using matplotlib."
"17.12"," In this session you learn about how to create a bar plot, how to customize a bar plot,"
"23.04"," and how to create a horizontal bar plot."
"25.28"," Okay."
"26.28"," I hope the agenda is clear to you guys."
"28.16"," So without delaying any further."
"29.88"," Let's quickly jump back to our Jupyter notebook and see how to create a bar plot using"
"34.0"," matplotlib."
"35.24"," So there's my Jupyter notebook."
"36.879999999999995"," This is where we left."
"39.6"," So what I'm doing here."
"41.96"," How to create a bar plot."
"45.72"," Right."
"46.72"," So again the very first thing that I'll be doing up here is importing my libraries."
"50.72"," So import numpy as np for creating my dataset."
"55.96"," So I'm going to put matplotlib.pyplot as plt for creating the visualization."
"64.88"," Then the sentage matplotlib in line for rendering the figure in the notebook."
"73.88"," Now what I'll do I'll create my dataset."
"76.16"," So here creating the dataset."
"80.84"," So let's define a dictionary up here."
"83.48"," So my data equal, let's say apples, how many apples, quantity, let's say 20."
"91.88000000000001"," Let's name a different fruit as mangoes, how many units of mangoes, let's say 15 unit"
"99.32000000000001"," of mangoes."
"100.96000000000001"," Then let's say lemon, lemon is 30 and one more, let's say oranges, let's make it as 10."
"112.44"," So let's separate the name and the values."
"116.12"," So let's define a parameter as names."
"118.32"," So name equal list of data dot keys."
"126.12"," And values equal list of data dot values."
"133.6"," Let's define the figure size."
"135.52"," So let's say figure equal dot dot figure, figure sizes, let's say 10, 5."
"145.76000000000002"," Now let's create the bar plot."
"148.64000000000001"," So creating the bar plot."
"152.64000000000001"," So plt dot bar inside that mention names and values, that's it."
"159.8"," So let's see what we just created."
"162.68"," So plt dot show executed, fix sizes, not defined."
"167.76000000000002"," Okay, I just missed the equals sign over here."
"170.20000000000002"," Okay, so this is how my bar chart looks like."
"173.20000000000002"," So now that we have created our bar chart, let's customize it."
"176.52"," So next is customizing the bar chart."
"182.08"," Let me just reuse this code."
"187.24"," So what all things I can add up here."
"189.36"," Let's add a title."
"190.96"," So plt dot title to our bar graph is bar graph demo."
"199.20000000000002"," Let's define the x label and the y label."
"201.36"," So plt dot x label is name of the fruit."
"206.0"," So fruits and plt dot y label is quantity of the fruit."
"213.20000000000002"," Okay, so let's see what output do we get."
"216.36"," So we got something like this."
"217.96"," Here you can see that the title of my graph is bar graph demo."
"222.28"," The x axis is the fruit and the y axis is quantity."
"226.4"," Now what if I want to change the color of these bars."
"229.24"," So for changing the color, I'll just add a parameter of here like color equal name of"
"234.04000000000002"," the color like orange and the six."
"236.48000000000002"," Here you can see that the color of my bar has been changed to orange."
"241.12"," Okay, now what if I want to create a horizontal bar graph."
"245.56"," Then that you don't have to do anything just write bar edge."
"250.36"," That's it."
"251.52"," And you'll get a horizontal bar graph."
"254.28"," So thank you guys."
"255.28"," This was all about how to create a bar graph using map plot lab."
"258.56"," In our next session, we will see how to create a scatter plot using map plot lab."
