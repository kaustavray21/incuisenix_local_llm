"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome back to Python certification course."
"8.6"," In our previous session we learned about what is pandas, what is various features, how"
"13.200000000000001"," it differs from numpy and how you can import the pandas library in python."
"17.36"," I hope those things are clear to you."
"19.96"," So moving on ahead, our today's session is on pandas series object."
"23.8"," So in this session we'll learn about what are the different types of data set in pandas,"
"28.24"," what is a series object, how to create a series object, how to check the type and how"
"34.08"," to change the index name of a series object."
"36.599999999999994"," I hope the agenda is clear to you guys."
"39.36"," So without delaying any further, let's see what are the different types of data set in"
"43.44"," pandas."
"45.480000000000004"," So we have one dimensional and multi-dimensional data."
"48.480000000000004"," So you can work on one dimensional two dimensional or any multi-dimensional data set in"
"53.2"," pandas."
"54.2"," If you are working on a one dimensional data set, it's known as a series object."
"57.76"," If you are working on a two dimensional, the pandas will create a data frame for it."
"62.12"," If you are working on more than two dimensional data, pandas would create a panel data for it."
"66.67999999999999"," Okay."
"67.67999999999999"," Time you might be wondering what are these terminologies, right?"
"70.4"," So let's have a look at them one by one."
"72.2"," So for this session, we'll be mainly focusing on series object."
"75.4"," So what exactly is the series object?"
"78.47999999999999"," Well, a series object in pandas is a one labeled array which is capable of holding any data"
"84.88"," type like integers, strings, floating point number, Python object, etc."
"89.36"," Okay."
"90.36"," It can contain data of similar or any mixed data type."
"93.8"," You can also say that a series in pandas is quite similar to a list or an array in Python."
"98.67999999999999"," But yet it's more powerful."
"100.75999999999999"," It represents a series of both numeric and non numeric values as a column of data containing"
"105.72"," any type of mixed data."
"107.6"," So you must remember the fact that a series can contain any type of data even if it's"
"111.67999999999999"," of a mixed data type."
"113.08"," Okay."
"114.08"," Let's see how we can create a series object in pandas."
"117.32"," So here in this example, we have a list of numeric data stored in data."
"121.72"," Okay."
"122.72"," And now we want to create a series object out of it."
"125.4"," So for this, panda has a function series with capital S. So here we are calling that function"
"131.12"," using PD dot series of data."
"133.68"," Okay."
"134.68"," And storing it in a variable or a series object name series one."
"138.92"," If you printed your notice that in the output, you have one dimensional array labeled as"
"143.76"," 0, 1, 2 and 3."
"145.79999999999998"," Let's make it more clear using my Jupyter notebook."
"149.32"," First topic is series object in pandas."
"156.72"," So the very first thing that I'll be doing up here is importing my pandas library."
"160.92"," So import pandas as PD."
"164.39999999999998"," Next I need to define the list of the data."
"166.68"," So let's say data equal 1, 2, 3 and 4."
"170.6"," Fine."
"171.6"," So I want to create a series object out of this one dimensional data."
"175.88"," So how will I do that for that?"
"177.35999999999999"," Let's define a series object name."
"179.12"," Let's say it's series one."
"180.92"," So series one equal PD dot series."
"185.68"," Make sure you are using capital S not small series and inside that past data."
"192.07999999999998"," Okay."
"193.07999999999998"," Now if you print your series one, you will see that you have one dimensional array of"
"197.4"," 1, 2, 3 and 4 which are labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3."
"201.64000000000001"," Okay."
"202.64000000000001"," So this was about series object in pandas."
"205.36"," So let's move ahead."
"207.12"," Next is how to check the type."
"209.32000000000002"," Now what if I want to check if it is a series object or not?"
"213.0"," So you can do it simply by typing the command type and inside that past the name of the object."
"218.92000000000002"," So here we have past series one as the name of the object."
"222.64000000000001"," Let's check it in our Jupyter notebook."
"225.08"," What it has to say."
"226.6"," So in order to check the type, all you have to do is mention type and inside this,"
"231.56"," write the name of the series object which is here series one."
"235.2"," So if you execute it, you will get the output as pandas dot code dot series dot series."
"240.6"," So definitely it's a series object."
"243.44"," Okay."
"244.44"," Now coming back to our PVD."
"246.24"," Next topic is how to change the index name."
"248.88"," Now what if I want to change the index name from 0, 1, 2, 3 to a, b, cd."
"253.6"," So how will I do it?"
"254.84"," So let's see."
"255.88"," So for that, all you have to do is add a new parameter index over there and define the index"
"261.04"," inside it."
"262.04"," That's it."
"263.04"," Let's see how."
"264.04"," So what we are doing up here."
"267.32"," Changing the index of a series object."
"273.08"," Okay."
"275.28000000000003"," So I don't want to write the entire code."
"278.32"," So let's just copy this thing."
"281.56"," And all you need to do is specify index parameter over here."
"285.4"," So index equal inside this."
"288.79999999999995"," Let's say first is a next is V next to see the last one D."
"295.03999999999996"," Okay."
"296.03999999999996"," And now if you execute series one, you'll see that the index name is changed."
"301.12"," So here we had index name as 0, 1 to 3, wish here changed to a, b, cd or customized index"
"308.0"," name."
"309.0"," Okay."
"310.0"," So I hope this thing is clear to you."
"311.59999999999997"," Well, next is create different series object data."
"315.08"," Well, pandas is not just about the list."
"317.71999999999997"," You can use different arrays."
"319.76"," You can use dictionary over there or you can use any scalar or any constant value to create"
"324.96"," a series object out of it."
"327.08"," Okay."
"328.08"," I hope the concept of series object is clear to you."
