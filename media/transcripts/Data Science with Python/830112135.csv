"0.0"," Well, in this session, we'll learn about various data types in Python."
"12.0"," Well, Python has majorly two data types, immutable data type and mutable data type."
"21.0"," Immutable are the one which cannot be changed or modified and mutable are the one which"
"26.0"," can be changed."
"27.0"," All right, immutable data type consists of numbers, strings and tuples."
"33.0"," On the other hand, mutable data type, they consist of lists, dictionaries and sets."
"39.0"," All right, so let's discuss about them one by one, starting with numbers."
"45.0"," So, under the topic of numeric little, I have already discussed that Python has four different types of numeric"
"51.0"," literals, integer, long integer, floating number and complex number."
"55.0"," Well, I have also told you that you don't need to specify the data type of a variable while you're declaring it."
"60.0"," Remember, Python would automatically convert a number from one type to another if it means."
"66.0"," Fine, don't worry if you want to explicitly convert one data type to another."
"70.0"," You can do it using int function, long function, float function or complex function."
"75.0"," All right, you have that option available with you."
"79.0"," For now, let's just move ahead and see how we can find the data type of a variable."
"84.0"," Let's see."
"87.0"," Suppose I'm declaring a integer variable equal 10."
"92.0"," Let's define a name."
"100.0"," As a Jill."
"102.0"," Now, what if I want to check the data type of these variables?"
"105.0"," So, how can I do that?"
"106.0"," So, for that, we have type function."
"108.0"," So, print the type of variable a."
"112.0"," All right, or print the type of variable name or print the type of variable,"
"128.0"," sality."
"130.0"," Fine, executed."
"132.0"," Sorry, there's a typo."
"136.0"," It's type, all right?"
"138.0"," So, you can see that variable a's of type integer, variable name is of type string,"
"144.0"," and variable salities of type float."
"147.0"," Fine, all right."
"149.0"," Let's get back to our tutorial."
"151.0"," So, this was about the numbers."
"154.0"," Next is strings."
"157.0"," Well, anything which is written under the single or double quotes is treated as a string."
"164.0"," All right, let's perform some operations on string and understand them in detail."
"173.0"," Suppose I have first string as"
"181.0"," Hello, old."
"185.0"," And my second string is in telepath."
"191.0"," All right."
"192.0"," Now, what if I want to print first character from the string one and the last character from string two?"
"198.0"," So, how will I do that?"
"200.0"," Let's see."
"201.0"," So, what you can do?"
"203.0"," Print STR1 and I need the first character."
"206.0"," So, my first character is at index number zero."
"209.0"," I'll just mention STR1 of zero."
"214.0"," And I want the last character from string two, right?"
"217.0"," So, print STR2."
"220.0"," So, if you want the last character, just specify minus one."
"225.0"," Executed."
"227.0"," So, you got the output as capital H and small t."
"231.0"," Since capital H is the first character from string one and small t is the last character from string two."
"241.0"," All right."
"242.0"," So, now, what if I need to extract Hello from Hello, old?"
"245.0"," So, how will I do that?"
"248.0"," What I need to do?"
"251.0"," Extract Hello from Hello, old."
"262.0"," So, all you need to do is print from with string, string one."
"269.0"," Hello, starting from zero and it should enter 01234."
"276.0"," It should enter 5."
"278.0"," All right."
"279.0"," And execute it."
"281.0"," So, you'll get the output as Hello."
"284.0"," Fine."
"286.0"," This is how you can collect the substring from a string."
"289.0"," One thing to remember is that if you check the index number of Hello,"
"294.0"," it would end at 01234."
"299.0"," Right."
"300.0"," So, when you want a substring, so you have to mention it as plus one."
"304.0"," So, 4 plus one is 5."
"306.0"," So, 0 till 5."
"308.0"," It won't include the fifth position."
"310.0"," Generally, if you are extracting a substring, the last number which are including that thing is not included."
"316.0"," It means that everything which would be between 0 and less than 5 would come as the substring."
"323.0"," All right."
"324.0"," Let's perform some operations on it."
"327.0"," So, first we have is the fine function."
"330.0"," So, what are these fine function?"
"332.0"," Well, this fine function returns the position of the string."
"336.0"," Let's take an example."
"338.0"," For example, I have a string as STR equal attachment."
"350.0"," And what I need to do, I want to find the position of the substring me from it."
"354.0"," So, STR dot find and inside that, just mention what you want to find."
"361.0"," Like I want to find the position of me."
"363.0"," That's executed."
"365.0"," So, you got the output as 6."
"367.0"," Why?"
"368.0"," Since, ME starts from 6."
"372.0"," 012345 and it's on sixth position."
"378.0"," So, that's why you got the position as 6."
"381.0"," Next is replace."
"384.0"," Well, this replace function is used to replace one character or string with other."
"389.0"," Fine."
"390.0"," It's like, what if I want to replace this ME with ME?"
"395.0"," So, STR dot replace."
"399.0"," What I want to replace?"
"402.0"," First, mention that."
"403.0"," I want to replace ME with what I want to replace."
"406.0"," It's M."
"409.0"," Fine."
"410.0"," Executed."
"411.0"," So, you got the output as attachment."
"414.0"," ATTACHMNT."
"417.0"," Fine."
"418.0"," ME is replaced with M."
"421.0"," One more thing that you can do up here is, let me just show you."
"426.0"," You can convert the word attachment into attach."
"429.0"," Let's see how."
"430.0"," Attach dot replace."
"434.0"," So, what you need to replace from here is MENT."
"438.0"," You don't want MENT from here."
"440.0"," So, what should you replace it with?"
"442.0"," You can replace it with space."
"444.0"," That's it."
"445.0"," If you're executed, you'll get the word attach."
"449.0"," What if I don't mention the space up here?"
"452.0"," Here you get the output as attach."
"454.0"," Even that work."
"455.0"," Alright."
"456.0"," Fine."
"458.0"," Next, we have as the split function."
"461.0"," Well, this function is used to create split on the base of a character."
"465.0"," For example, I have a split string which consists of word 1 comma word 2 comma word 3."
"480.0"," So, all these three different words are separated by comma."
"484.0"," So, what I want to do, I want to split the entire string on the base of comma."
"489.0"," So, I'll write split str dot split on the base of comma and executed."
"503.0"," So, as you can see, I got the output as three different words."
"507.0"," Word 1, word 2 and word 3."
"510.0"," Let's move ahead."
"512.0"," Next is the count function."
"514.0"," Well, count function returns the count of the character in the string."
"518.0"," For example, let's take a string as str 3 equals IntelliBat."
"530.0"," Now, I want to find the count of letter i from this particular string."
"536.0"," So, str 3 dot count I'll mention i."
"543.0"," Let's execute it."
"545.0"," So, what do you think the output should be?"
"547.0"," i n t e double l ip double a t."
"552.0"," So, you think it should be 2?"
"555.0"," Well, according to me, it will be 1."
"558.0"," I'll tell you why."
"560.0"," See, the output is 1."
"562.0"," Because, remember, I told you Python is case sensitive."
"566.0"," So, both the upper case and lower cases are treated differently."
"570.0"," So, if I'm searching for small i, that small i is just appearing once."
"574.0"," So, I got the count of small i as 1."
"578.0"," Now, what if I convert the string to upper case?"
"584.0"," dot u dot upper."
"588.0"," Let's convert it to upper case."
"592.0"," Okay, that's it."
"593.0"," str 3 dot upper."
"595.0"," So, give me IntelliBat."
"598.0"," Let's store it in some variable like str 4 equal str 3 dot upper."
"605.0"," Fine."
"608.0"," Now, if you count the number of i's in str 4,"
"612.0"," you'll get the output as 2."
"619.0"," By, since in capital IntelliBat, you have 2 i's."
"624.0"," Alright."
"627.0"," Fine."
"630.0"," So, we discussed about the upper, which converts the character string to the upper case."
"636.0"," Fine."
"637.0"," Next is the max or men function."
"639.0"," Well, these functions are used to return the max or men ascii values."
"645.0"," For example, let's take a string 5 as anything."
"651.0"," For example, exclamation mark, add the rate, hash, 1 to 3,"
"656.0"," capital A, small B, small A, C, capital C."
"661.0"," Alright."
"663.0"," So, this is my string 5."
"665.0"," Now, I want to find the maximum ascii value from it."
"669.0"," So, what I'll do, I'll just write max str 5."
"675.0"," Execute it."
"679.0"," I must do mention this."
"682.0"," Put it under the codes."
"685.0"," Execute it."
"686.0"," So, the character with maximum ascii value is small C."
"691.0"," Alright."
"694.0"," Or, what if I want to find the minimum ascii value from string 5?"
"701.0"," Let's check for that."
"703.0"," So, minimum ascii value in string 5 is of exclamation mark."
"709.0"," Fine."
"710.0"," So, let's move ahead."
"712.0"," So, well, next we have is the tuple."
"716.0"," The tuple are a group of values within the parentheses."
"719.0"," And since they are immutable data type, so the values within the tuples cannot be changed."
"724.0"," For example, we have defined a tuple up here as mygroup equal A, B, C and D."
"731.0"," Alright."
"732.0"," So, this is the example of a tuple."
"735.0"," So, let's move ahead and perform some operations on it to understand and detail."
"740.0"," Let's get back to our Jupyter notebook."
"742.0"," Let's define a tuple as my tuple equal within the parentheses."
"750.0"," I'll mention A, B, then C and D."
"766.0"," Alright."
"767.0"," So, this is my tuple."
"768.0"," So, the very first function that we are going to perform on it is concatenation."
"772.0"," So, what are these concatenation?"
"774.0"," It is used to add two strings or character."
"778.0"," Alright."
"781.0"," Basically, concatenation is used to add two or more tuples."
"786.0"," Alright."
"788.0"," For example, I'll define another tuple as my tuple 1 equal A."
"794.0"," And then, equal E and F."
"807.0"," So, if I need to concatenate it, I'll just write my tuple plus equal my tuple 1."
"823.0"," And let's print it."
"827.0"," Print my tuple."
"831.0"," Let's see the output."
"833.0"," We've got an error as invalid syntax."
"840.0"," What is the invalid syntax of here?"
"848.0"," Something is invalid here."
"851.0"," Let's define it again."
"881.0"," Okay."
"882.0"," The semicolon is missing up here."
"889.0"," Is it muted?"
"890.0"," So, yeah."
"891.0"," So, this concatenated me and gave me the result as A, B, C, D, E, and F."
"897.0"," So, this is how concatenation is done in tuple."
"904.0"," Catenation."
"913.0"," Next we have is the repetition."
"916.0"," Reputation is used to duplicate the string or character for a given number of times."
"921.0"," For example, what if I want to double the contents in my tuple?"
"925.0"," So, I'll just write my tuple multiplied by 2."
"931.0"," And again, that's it."
"936.0"," My tuple multiplied by 2 and hit enter."
"939.0"," So, you'll get the output as double values of A, B, C, D, E, and F."
"944.0"," Fine."
"945.0"," So, this is how a repetition is done in a tuple."
"951.0"," So, let's move ahead."
"954.0"," Next function that we need to perform is indexing."
"958.0"," Indexing shows the index position of a character or a string within the group or within the tuple."
"965.0"," For example, I want to find what character is present at the index number 1."
"976.0"," So, I'll just write my tuple of 1."
"979.0"," So, at first index, B is present over there."
"983.0"," Like A is present as 0th index, B at 1, C at 2, D at 3 and so on."
"989.0"," Fine."
"990.0"," So, this is how indexing is done in tuple."
"994.0"," Next is slicing."
"997.0"," Slicing shows a specific set of index character or string."
"1002.0"," For example, I want a specific set of strings which slice between the index number 1, 2, 4."
"1012.0"," So, my tuple, I want a specific set of string which slice between 1, 2, 4."
"1020.0"," So, this is my 0th, 1, 2, 3, and 4."
"1025.0"," Fine."
"1026.0"," So, I'll get the output as B, C, D, and E."
"1031.0"," Let's check it."
"1032.0"," So, I got the output as B, C, D, and E."
"1036.0"," Fine."
"1037.0"," Alright."
"1038.0"," So, let's move ahead."
"1042.0"," So, next we have is the list."
"1046.0"," List is a sequence of mutable Python data type which is defined within the square brackets."
"1052.0"," And now since they are mutable, they can be easily changed."
"1056.0"," Let's move ahead and perform some operations on an understand written detail."
"1061.0"," So, what is an example?"
"1063.0"," Okay."
"1064.0"," So, we define a list as A, 10, 7, 1, 2, and data."
"1068.0"," So, it is consisting of mixed data type values."
"1070.0"," It even has an integer of load and a string."
"1073.0"," Fine."
"1074.0"," Let's get back to our notebook and define a list."
"1079.0"," So, this is my list."
"1083.0"," My list."
"1087.0"," Equal within parentheses."
"1091.0"," A string."
"1094.0"," A number."
"1097.0"," A decimal."
"1109.0"," And a string with multiple character."
"1113.0"," Fine."
"1115.0"," So, this is my list."
"1117.0"," Now, let's see what are the operations that we need to perform on it."
"1120.0"," First is concatenation."
"1122.0"," Well, again, the concatenation is same as the one which we learnt in tuple."
"1127.0"," It is used to add two or more lists together."
"1130.0"," Let's define another list as my list 2."
"1135.0"," My list 2 consists of element as let's take python or at consist of integer."
"1147.0"," Now, what if I want to concatenate my list with my list 2?"
"1151.0"," So, what I'll do?"
"1153.0"," My list plus equal my list 2."
"1158.0"," Let's see what is the result."
"1162.0"," Let's print the value of my list."
"1168.0"," So, you got the result as a 1 to 3 3 1 1 4 John python 20."
"1177.0"," So, you got this result 2 times because I executed it twice."
"1182.0"," Sorry for it."
"1185.0"," So, what you can do?"
"1187.0"," You can just"
"1196.0"," my list dot remove."
"1202.0"," Hold on."
"1203.0"," I don't want to execute this entire list or statement."
"1206.0"," So, I'll define it under different block."
"1209.0"," So, my list dot remove python."
"1230.0"," I'm spelled python."
"1234.0"," Remove this."
"1236.0"," Again, remove this."
"1241.0"," And remove 20."
"1245.0"," Again, remove 20."
"1247.0"," If you're in remove it, you'll get an error."
"1253.0"," So, see what we have currently in my list."
"1259.0"," Let's print it."
"1262.0"," Let's get back up here and executed just once."
"1271.0"," So, as you can see, my list got updated with python and 20."
"1278.0"," Fine."
"1285.0"," Next is reputation."
"1288.0"," Well, reputation is again same as tuple."
"1291.0"," It is used to duplicate your list with a number of times."
"1296.0"," Well, next is reputation."
"1298.0"," It is used to multiply your list by a number of times."
"1302.0"," For example, my list into 2 would duplicate your list with each element appearing twice in the list."
"1308.0"," Alright."
"1310.0"," Fine."
"1311.0"," Next is slicing."
"1315.0"," Again, same as tuple."
"1317.0"," If you want a specific portion of a list, you can just mention the starting index number and the ending index number plus one."
"1325.0"," And it would return as the slice list."
"1328.0"," Alright."
"1329.0"," For example, as you can see here on the screen, we have my list and inside that we have a 1 3.14 and python."
"1338.0"," And we want a sub list from 1 to 4th index number."
"1342.0"," Like 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 plus 1 4th won't be included."
"1349.0"," So, we'll get the output as 1 3.4 and 3.14 and python."
"1355.0"," Alright."
"1357.0"," Next is append."
"1359.0"," Well, append is adding any value to a list."
"1364.0"," It's almost same as the function what we did up here."
"1369.0"," Right."
"1370.0"," It's like my list dot append and add any values with which you want to append."
"1380.0"," Like I want to append with 10."
"1383.0"," And print my list."
"1387.0"," That's it."
"1389.0"," So, as you can see, we got 10 in the end."
"1394.0"," Fine."
"1395.0"," So, moving on ahead, next we have is extend."
"1407.0"," Well, again, extend is another function which is used to concatenate two different string."
"1413.0"," Alright."
"1414.0"," Example I'll define my list 3 as c and d."
"1427.0"," And I want to append my list with my list 3."
"1435.0"," Let's print and see what result do we get."
"1444.0"," So, as you can see up here, c and d got added with my list."
"1449.0"," Fine."
"1450.0"," Well, next is insert."
"1453.0"," Well, using the index number, you can specify any value in between the list."
"1460.0"," For example, I want to insert a number before 3.14."
"1464.0"," So, I'll write my list dot insert."
"1471.0"," I'll mention the index number."
"1474.0"," My index number is 0, 1."
"1478.0"," I want it after 1."
"1482.0"," And what value I want."
"1484.0"," For example, I want to insert at 20, 30."
"1488.0"," Fine."
"1489.0"," Let's print my list and see what is the result."
"1499.0"," You cannot use a string up here."
"1501.0"," You just have to mention the number index number."
"1506.0"," So, yeah."
"1507.0"," You got my list at first position."
"1513.0"," So, what if I want to insert it before 3.14?"
"1516.0"," That was my target, right?"
"1517.0"," Now, your updated string is this 0, 1, 2, 3."
"1521.0"," So, you want to insert it at third position."
"1524.0"," And you want to insert 40."
"1526.0"," So, at third position, that is 0, 1, 2, 3."
"1530.0"," So, after 1, 2, 3, 40 would come."
"1533.0"," So, after 1, 2, 3, 4 days up here."
"1535.0"," Alright."
"1537.0"," So, this is how you can insert any number at a given index number."
"1541.0"," So, this was all about list."
"1544.0"," I hope you understood the difference between list and a tuple."
"1547.0"," If not, let me just summarize it again."
"1550.0"," A tuple is immutable while a list is immutable."
"1554.0"," Open and close brackets are used when you are grouping items under it."
"1557.0"," And in the case of list, square brackets are used."
"1561.0"," Fine."
"1562.0"," So, this was all about the list."
"1564.0"," So, let's move ahead and discuss about dictionaries."
"1568.0"," Well, these are more flexible data type and Python."
"1575.0"," And you define a group within the curly braces."
"1578.0"," Fine."
"1579.0"," While defining the elements in a dictionary, you have two elements,"
"1584.0"," key and its value."
"1587.0"," Fine."
"1589.0"," Or in other words, we can say that we define an index for each element."
"1594.0"," Let's explore various operations that we can perform using dictionary."
"1599.0"," So, first one is defining an empty dictionary."
"1603.0"," Don't mention anything within the curly braces."
"1606.0"," That would be an empty dictionary."
"1608.0"," Alright."
"1609.0"," Next is integer keys."
"1613.0"," That is dictionary with integer keys."
"1616.0"," For example, one apple, two ball."
"1618.0"," So, the key, one and two are just integer, right?"
"1622.0"," So, it's a dictionary with integer keys."
"1625.0"," Next is mixed keys."
"1627.0"," Dextenary with mixed keys."
"1630.0"," That is, we have key of mixed data type."
"1632.0"," For example, name is string up here."
"1634.0"," One is integer, right?"
"1637.0"," This is mixed key."
"1640.0"," Next, we have is pairing."
"1643.0"," That is from sequence having each item as a pair."
"1646.0"," Dictionary, one apple, two ball, all are taken as a pair element."
"1651.0"," Fine."
"1657.0"," Next is accessing dictionary."
"1660.0"," So, what if I want to access a dictionary?"
"1663.0"," So, I can directly access using the key."
"1665.0"," Fine."
"1666.0"," For example, the word one is associated with key one."
"1670.0"," And word two is associated with key two."
"1673.0"," So, if I want to access word one, I can directly write my dictionary of one."
"1678.0"," And it will give me output as word one."
"1681.0"," Fine."
"1683.0"," Let's move ahead."
"1685.0"," Now, what if I want to find the length of the dictionary?"
"1688.0"," Then I can directly do it using the length function."
"1691.0"," Length of my dictionary is giving me the output as two."
"1695.0"," Why?"
"1696.0"," Since it consists of two elements."
"1698.0"," Word one and word two."
"1700.0"," Fine."
"1701.0"," Next is key."
"1703.0"," Now, what if I want to find the key of my dictionary?"
"1707.0"," So, I can just use the key function."
"1709.0"," Mydictionary.key."
"1711.0"," It is returning me all the keys within the dictionary."
"1715.0"," Fine."
"1717.0"," It is returning me all the key defined within the dictionary."
"1723.0"," Next is value."
"1725.0"," Well, this function is used to return all the values defined within the dictionary."
"1729.0"," For example, we have apple and ball as value within this dictionary."
"1734.0"," Mydict."
"1735.0"," Alright."
"1736.0"," So, that's why using value function, we got the output as apple and ball."
"1741.0"," Fine."
"1742.0"," Let's move ahead."
"1745.0"," Okay."
"1746.0"," So, now that you have learned about dictionary, so let's discuss about the last data type"
"1750.0"," that is set."
"1752.0"," Sets are the unordered collection of item within the curly braces."
"1756.0"," That is, items are defined within the opening and the closing curly braces."
"1761.0"," And you don't have to define the key value on it."
"1764.0"," It is basically unordered collection of item."
"1767.0"," If you are adding elements in the set, then make sure that every element in the set is unique."
"1772.0"," For example, you can define a set as myset equal 1 to 3."
"1777.0"," Well, it's almost similar to as dictionary, right?"
"1780.0"," But it is not has any key value associated to it."
"1784.0"," It's the only difference between a set and a dictionary."
"1787.0"," Alright."
"1788.0"," Let's perform some of the function using set and understand it in a better way."
"1793.0"," So, the first one is creating set."
"1795.0"," You already created a set."
"1797.0"," Alright."
"1800.0"," Next is union."
"1802.0"," Well, union of two sets, return the common value from both the set."
"1807.0"," For example, myset s1 equal 1, 2 and c."
"1811.0"," Myset s2 consists of 1 b and c."
"1815.0"," So, if I am performing a union on it, so it is returning me with 1, 2 c and b."
"1821.0"," So, basically what it is doing, it is returning me the common values of both the set."
"1826.0"," Fine."
"1829.0"," Next is the intersection."
"1831.0"," Well, intersection is used to return the common result from both of them."
"1835.0"," That is, and of myset s1 and myset s2."
"1839.0"," So, what are the common elements in both of them?"
"1842.0"," We have 1, 2, c, 1 b, c."
"1844.0"," So, we have 1 and c common in both the set."
"1847.0"," So, we got the output as 1 and c."
"1849.0"," Fine."
"1851.0"," Next is the difference."
"1855.0"," Well, this difference would omit all the common value from both the set."
"1861.0"," And it will return the only value which is a unique and first set."
"1866.0"," For example, we have 1, 2, c and set 1."
"1869.0"," And 1, v, c and set 2."
"1872.0"," So, this was all for this session."
"1874.0"," In our next session, we will learn about different types of flow control that you can use in Python."
"1878.0"," Thank you."
"1884.0"," You"
