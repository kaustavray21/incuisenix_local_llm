"0.0"," So where I'll do is I'll start by importing all of the packages. So I'll type in import"
"11.36"," fundaars as PD. I'll also type import map lotlib. So this needs to be from map lotlib import"
"23.98"," by plot as plt and I'd also go ahead and import the numpy library. So I'll type in import numpy"
"30.98"," as np. Let me go ahead and load all of the packages. So we have successfully loaded"
"40.66"," this packages. Now let me go ahead and also load the data set. This is a CSV file. So"
"47.54"," I'll use pd.kcsv to load up this file and I'll type in the name of the data set which"
"54.54"," would be customer churn.csv and I'll store this in a new object and name the object to"
"61.74"," be. I'll actually name this to be customer. Now let me have a glance at the top few regards"
"68.25999999999999"," of this data set. So I'll type in customer.head and this is a data set which will be working"
"73.86"," with. So these are all the columns. So we've got the customer ID. We've got the gender"
"78.22"," we custom over the customer. So the senior citizen or not. This tells us if the customer"
"83.46"," has a partner if the customer has independence and is the tenure. So this basically tells"
"88.38"," us how long the customer has been using the network and then where the customer uses"
"93.3"," phone servers multiple lines. So these are the different varieties of columns we have"
"97.53999999999999"," over here. So we are supposed to build a barboard for this internet service column and as we"
"102.3"," see over here, fiber optic comes around 3000 times and there are 2421 customers for using"
"107.94"," DSL and there are 1526 customers or not even availing the internet service. We have"
"112.7"," this value counts over here. Now we need a 3 bar for these 3 different values. So what"
"118.5"," are Lewis? I will actually convert this into a list. So I'll type in to list and so let"
"125.94"," me actually show you what this has. So there is something known as key and value over"
"130.54"," here. Keyes. Let me copy and base it over here. This time I don't want values. Very"
"139.94"," it's not callable. Okay, let me just remove this out. Let me actually also remove this."
"149.01999999999998"," So when I just put in keys, what I get is I don't have the value counts of it. I just"
"153.38"," have the names of the keys. So fiber optic DSL and no. So first what I'll do is I will"
"158.82"," give in the names to these parts. So the names would be coming from this list over here."
"163.54"," So fiber optic DSL and no. I'd have to convert this to a list. So I'll type in to list"
"170.29999999999998"," and after this, I'd have to give in the values. So over here, I just remove this key function"
"177.14"," and I'll have result. Let me just put in PLD.Show. So we have a barboard over here. So we"
"185.74"," have fiber optic DSL and no. And from this graph, it is very clearly visible that you"
"191.78"," are around 3000 dot customers using fiber optic 2500 dot customers using DSL and around 1500"
"199.22"," dot customers who don't even have internet service. Now we'd have to go ahead and give the"
"203.5"," labels for this plot. So we'd have to assign the x-axis label y-axis label title and we'd"
"208.06"," have to change the color of the bars. Let's do that PLD.Show. I'll show which bar do you"
"214.86"," want me to explain, darling? This barboard, has it? Yeah, I'm talking about this too."
"219.34"," Like you put customer, then internet service dot value count dot tool list. Why did you"
"224.42000000000002"," use value count and then tool list twice? So let me remove this over here. This is the"
"231.26000000000002"," first parameter in this barboard. Now what I'm doing is I have this part from customer"
"237.38000000000002"," to internet service. This is where I'm extracting only the internet service. And then with"
"243.3"," the help of value counts, I'm getting this result over here. So I'll have the names of"
"248.70000000000002"," the levels in this column. And I'll also have the value counts of each of these levels."
"253.70000000000002"," Now when I just put in keys over here, I'll get this. So I'll not get the top of it."
"260.3"," I'll just get the names. So the names are fiber optic DSL and no. Now this barboard over"
"267.1"," here, it takes a list as a parameter. That is why I'm converting these into a list."
"273.82000000000005"," So this is clear. This is the first parameter. Now I'll give you the second parameter. So"
"279.82000000000005"," for the second parameter, I'd have to give in the values. So over here, I've just given"
"284.54"," the names, but I'd also have to give the values. So to give the values, I'll type in customer."
"289.46"," I'll do the same thing. I'll type in internet service and after that, I'll do value count."
"296.58"," This time, since I actually want the value counts and not just the keys, I'll only use"
"302.09999999999997"," value counts. And again, I'll convert this to a list. Right? And when I print this, this"
"307.82"," is what I get. These on the y axis, what you see, these are the value counts. And on the"
"313.74"," x axis, what you see, these are the names or these are the keys or the different levels."
"318.46000000000004"," Thank you. If you only print the value counts means customer in the bracket, it's internet"
"323.70000000000005"," service dot value counts only that said. Will it print just like an input number 22? If we"
"330.06"," write plot dot bar customer internet service dot value counts, that's it. If we remove rest"
"336.34000000000003"," of the things after the keys and more keys, we also. Yeah. That's it. So by default,"
"347.86"," when you give a bar plot, you'd have to value something to go on the x axis and something"
"352.3"," to go on the y axis. So you can't just given the value and the y value. Right? So the"
"358.58000000000004"," arrow is missing one required positional argument. So let me put this out over here again."
"365.66"," As I was saying, we'd have to add the labels now. So let me just add the labels, the"
"371.1"," ld dot x label and the x label would be categories of internet service. Similarly, I'll add the"
"379.90000000000003"," y label. So it'll be blt dot y label and this would be count of categories. And then I'll"
"388.34000000000003"," give them the title. So it'll be blt dot title and the title would be distribution of internet"
"395.42"," service. Now let me print this out. I've added the x axis label, the y axis label and the title"
"400.86"," for this. Now we also have to change the color of the bars. So in the main function over here,"
"405.82"," plt dot bar, I'll add in a new positional argument. That would be color. I'll set the color"
"411.58000000000004"," to be equal to orange. Right? So we have to also change the color over here. Now there is actually"
"418.7"," an interesting thing over here. So let's say, instead of a vertical plot, if you wanted a horizontal"
"423.42"," bar plot, so all you have to do is add in plt dot bar h over here. So instead of a vertical plot,"
"429.66"," you'll get a horizontal plot. And then we'd have to go ahead and build a histogram for the 10-year"
"434.86"," column. So let me build a histogram. So it'll be plt dot his and then I'll give him a name of"
"442.94000000000005"," the data free man. Then I'll give him the name of the column, which would be 10-year. So this"
"448.38"," is pretty much it. So building a histogram is extremely easy. This type in plt dot show over here."
"456.21999999999997"," Now, this one you see, so the bins, you know, the bin width is very large. So we can't really get"
"462.21999999999997"," a proper understanding of the distribution. So I'll go ahead and change the number of bins over"
"466.7"," here. So I'll type in bins and that means that it will equal to 30. So we have, you know, we can"
"472.85999999999996"," have a greater distribution or a greater understanding of this histogram. Now, and then similarly,"
"477.34"," we'd have to add the title to this and then we'd have to change the color of the bins to green."
"483.58"," So I'll set the color of bins to be equal to green and then I'll add a title. So plt dot title,"
"493.34000000000003"," this would be distribution of 10-year. What's the purpose of bins? This increases the number of"
"501.58"," bins. If I remove this from over here, I'll have a default value of the number of bins over here."
"507.97999999999996"," Let's say the default value is 15 or 20. Now, if you want to increase the number of bins,"
"514.4599999999999"," you'll use this. Now, let me put it to 50, which a number of bins increases or the bin width"
"521.98"," basically decreases. So if the bin width decreases, you'll have greater number of bins and you can"
"526.78"," have a better understanding of how the data is distributed. Let me change this to 100. Then you'll"
"533.1800000000001"," have even greater number of bins. So this is what you have over here. Let me reduce the number of"
"538.46"," bins. Let me set it to 5 and let's see what do we get. So you just have 5 and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5."
"543.4200000000001"," So this is how it works."
