"0.0"," So, this would be the last session from the first module and we'll end this session by giving"
"9.44"," you a brief understanding of classes and objects."
"11.88"," Don't worry, we'll discuss about them in detail in our next module on Python Oops."
"17.16"," Next we have is Python classes and objects."
"19.240000000000002"," So what is a class and object in Python?"
"21.52"," Well, Python is an object oriented programming language and almost everything in Python"
"26.400000000000002"," is an object with its properties and method."
"29.16"," In class, it's like a blueprint for creating objects."
"34.52"," Let's see an example of class."
"36.480000000000004"," We define a classes class space, class name, colon and inside that you define its objects."
"42.84"," If you want to call a object, let's see how you call it."
"45.84"," You're defining a variable as obj1 and you are assigning all the object of my class to"
"51.56"," it."
"52.56"," And if you want to print one of the variable of my class, so you can access it using obj1."
"58.04"," All right."
"59.04"," So this was about the classes and object in Python."
"63.959999999999994"," Well, this was all for this module."
"66.2"," In our next module, we'll learn about Python Oops concept."
"69.56"," Thank you."
