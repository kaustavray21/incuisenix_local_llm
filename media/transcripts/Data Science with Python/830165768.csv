"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome to Python certification course."
"8.0"," In our previous session we learned about how to create and customize a bar plot."
"12.48"," Our today's session is about how to create a scatter plot using Matplotlib."
"17.0"," So in this session you will learn how to create a scatter plot and how to customize it."
"23.92"," So without delaying any further, let's quickly jump back to our Jupyter Notebook and see"
"28.56"," how to plot a scatter plot using Matplotlib."
"31.56"," So there's my Jupyter Notebook where we left."
"35.04"," So now what I am doing is how to create a scatter plot."
"41.04"," Let's add a new cell up here."
"42.56"," Let's import the required libraries."
"44.32"," So for this I'll be importing this Matplotlib.pyplot as PLD."
"53.04"," So I'll be importing this library to create my visualization."
"56.24"," Next Matplotlib in line."
"60.88"," So now what I'll do, I'll create my data set."
"63.08"," So creating the data set."
"66.28"," So let's define like a equal, let's say, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80."
"76.28"," Okay."
"77.28"," B equal."
"79.08"," Then let's take some random numbers like 5, 4, 3, 2, 5, 6, 1, 4, 2."
"87.96"," Okay."
"88.96"," And here let's define another variable X as 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2."
"98.2"," So now that we have prepared our data set, so our next task would be to create the scatter"
"102.84"," plot."
"103.84"," Creating the scatter plot."
"108.0"," So PLT.scatter a comma b, okay."
"113.96"," PLT.scatter a comma X, fine?"
"119.0"," And finally lot dot show."
"123.48"," Let's see what is the output."
"126.96000000000001"," So here you can see that we have a as the x-axis and b and x as the y-axis."
"132.64"," So both the b and x-axis plotted up here as blue and orange point."
"137.2"," So we don't know exactly which one is b and which one is x, right?"
"141.67999999999998"," So just by looking at the visualization, we cannot say which one is b and which one is"
"146.2"," x, right?"
"147.2"," So let's customize it and make it more clear."
"151.11999999999998"," So here, customizing our scatter plot."
"157.92"," So this was our code, okay?"
"160.23999999999998"," So first of all, I'll add legend to my graph in order to distinguish between which one"
"164.56"," of them is b and which one of them is x, okay?"
"168.76"," So PLT.legend inside this, first is b and the next is x."
"178.4"," Specify the location, the location will be the best location, wherever is the best location"
"184.04"," possible."
"185.04"," Let's execute it."
"186.04"," So here you can see we got the legend as blue color is for the b data and orange color"
"190.68"," is for the x data."
"192.72"," Let's verify it."
"193.72"," We had b as five."
"195.8"," So yeah, it's correct, okay?"
"197.88"," So now let's add some title to our graph."
"200.16"," So PLT.title, let's say scatter plot demo, okay?"
"210.72"," Let's name the x-axis and y-axis."
"213.56"," PLT.x label is x-axis and plot.y label is y-axis, okay?"
"228.4"," Let's execute it."
"229.88"," So we got our label and the title."
"232.08"," So now what we can do, we can customize the color size, edge colors, marker and alpha"
"238.36"," value of this scatter plot."
"240.32"," So let's see how to do it."
"241.8"," So here we have a comma b."
"243.84"," So just write comma color, let's say I want to keep it as green, okay?"
"250.20000000000002"," Let's say the size is 300, okay?"
"253.44"," The edge color is let's say yellow."
"258.56"," Shape of the marker is somewhat like this and the value of alpha that is the opacity is"
"268.48"," 0.5, okay?"
"272.28000000000003"," And let's do the same change for the x, okay?"
"277.12"," Now let's just change these values, make this to red."
"284.28000000000003"," Let's make the size to 400, edge color to let's say blue, marker, let's make it, let's"
"292.20000000000005"," say 4 and alpha to 1."
"296.8"," It's executed."
"298.56"," So we got the output as this."
"301.36"," For b, the color is green, size is 300, edge color is yellow, marker is circle and it's"
"307.44"," transparent."
"308.44"," And its opacity or transparency is 0.5."
"311.64"," While in the case of x value, its color is red, size is 400, edge color is as blue,"
"318.84000000000003"," marker, for and alpha or opacity is 1."
"322.24"," So we got the shape."
"323.64"," If we change to 200, the size will decrease, okay?"
"328.91999999999996"," If you want, you can even save your visualization up here using savefig, okay?"
"335.0"," So PLT.savefigure as scatterplot.png is executed."
"346.12"," So if I less saved as scatterplot.png."
"349.24"," So you can even add grid to your plot."
"350.96000000000004"," So PLT.grid inside this pass the parameter as true, executed."
"357.48"," So you'll get the grid in your plot."
"359.68"," You can even save your visualization using PLT.savefigure and inside this pass the parameter as"
"366.88"," the name of the file."
"368.08"," So let's say scatterplot.png."
"371.04"," So this will save this plot in a png format."
"377.32"," So this was about the scatterplot."
"382.08"," In our next session, we'll learn how to create a histogram using Matrotlib."
