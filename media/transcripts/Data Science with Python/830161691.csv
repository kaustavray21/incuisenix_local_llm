"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome back to Python certification course."
"8.58"," In our previous session we learned about series object."
"11.34"," We saw what exactly is a series object and how to use it."
"15.42"," Right?"
"16.42"," I hope those things are clear to you."
"18.98"," So moving on ahead, today's session will be on Pandas data frame."
"23.28"," So in this session you will learn about what exactly is a data frame."
"28.34"," What are the various features of a data frame and finally how to create a data frame."
"33.84"," So without delaying any further, let's start with what is data frame."
"40.44"," Well as I told you earlier in Pandas two-dimensional data is found in the form of data frames."
"46.28"," So now the question arises what exactly is a data frame?"
"50.519999999999996"," Well a data frame is a two-dimensional label data with columns which can contain data"
"56.16"," of different types."
"58.64"," Let me show you an example."
"60.32"," So here in this example you can see we have a two-dimensional data with the column label"
"65.32"," on the x axis and the index on the y axis."
"69.48"," Correct?"
"70.32"," So this is an example of a data frame."
"72.24"," So now that you know what exactly is a data frame, let's move ahead and see what are"
"76.6"," the different features of a data frame."
"81.4"," So a data frame contains column of different types."
"84.64"," We can even change the size of a data frame as it is mutable."
"88.4"," You can even have data axis labeled and you can also perform various arithmetic operations"
"93.48"," on rows and columns."
"95.36"," So these are the various features of a data frame."
"97.8"," So now that you know what exactly is a data frame, let's see how to create one."
"103.16"," So you can create a data frame using this command, pd.datafram and inside that mention"
"108.76"," the data."
"109.76"," Okay?"
"110.76"," Let me just open my jippetanode book and show you how exactly it is created."
"115.24000000000001"," So this is my jippetanode book."
"118.12"," This is where we left in our previous session."
"120.68"," So today we'll learn how to create a data frame."
"125.48"," Okay?"
"128.24"," Let me just change it to markdown."
"130.72"," So again, in order to create a data frame, the very first thing that you'll be doing"
"134.28"," is importing the panda library."
"136.52"," So import pandas, let's say I want to import pandas as pd."
"140.92000000000002"," I don't want to use the name pandas again and again."
"143.88000000000002"," Okay?"
"144.88"," So now that I have imported my library, let me just define some data."
"148.60000000000002"," So let's say data equal 1, 2, 3, 4, 5."
"154.76000000000002"," And now I want to create a data frame."
"156.56"," So let's say df equal pd.datafram and inside that what I need to pass is the data."
"165.04"," And this makes sure that your d and f is capitalized."
"170.28"," Okay?"
"171.28"," And let's print the data frame."
"173.51999999999998"," Let's see what is the output."
"175.39999999999998"," Okay?"
"176.39999999999998"," So here we got the output of data frame."
"178.39999999999998"," So as you can see on our x-axis, we got the label as 0 and on the y-axis, we got the"
"183.64"," index as 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4."
"187.6"," So there's a simple example of a data frame."
"190.16"," So this data frame was created using list."
"192.72"," So let me just add this creating a data frame using a list."
"200.04"," Okay?"
"201.04"," So next what I'll do, I'll show you an example of creating a data frame using a dictionary."
"210.44"," So let's define our dictionary."
"213.4"," So let's say my dictionary equals, because I there, so I'll write fruits."
"218.04"," So my fruit consists of a array of different fruits like apples, banana and mango."
"226.35999999999999"," So let's add one more key value to it."
"228.56"," So let's say I'm adding count."
"231.0"," So count equal, I have 10 apples, 20 bananas and let's say 15 mangoes."
"237.23999999999998"," So here I have defined my dictionary."
"239.56"," Now I need to create a data frame out of it."
"242.12"," So let's say data frame equal panda PD dot data frame DNF capital."
"250.12"," And inside this I'll pass my dictionary."
"253.68"," And let's print it out."
"257.76"," So as you can see here, we got a data frame with the labels as fruits and count and the"
"263.0"," index over here as 0, 1 and 2."
"265.92"," Okay?"
"266.92"," So this is how we create a data frame using a dictionary."
"270.36"," So now that you know how to create a data frame using a list and a dictionary."
"274.92"," Now let me show you how you can create a series."
"278.04"," Well, the series is the same which we learned in our previous session."
"281.48"," It's a one-dimensional label array which is capable of holding data of any type."
"286.28000000000003"," You can store, you can have any integer, string, float or any kind of value on it."
"291.92"," Okay?"
"292.92"," Let me show you how you can do it."
"293.92"," So here what we are doing."
"295.28"," So here we are creating a data frame using a series."
"300.96"," Okay?"
"301.96"," So let's define our series."
"304.28"," Let's say series equal PD dot series inside this."
"310.88"," Let's say I have 6, 12 and also let me specify the index."
"317.67999999999995"," So let's say index equal a comma B."
"323.16"," So there is my one-dimensional array with its defined index."
"327.56"," Okay?"
"328.56"," Now I want to create a data frame out of a series."
"331.40000000000003"," So how will I do it?"
"332.68"," So let's see."
"333.68"," So df equal PD dot data frame with DNF capital and inside this I'll pass the series."
"343.12"," Okay?"
"344.12"," Now let's just print it."
"345.12"," So as you can see here we got this output."
"347.72"," So here are one-dimensional series got converted to two-dimensional data frame with index"
"352.92"," as a and b."
"354.2"," Okay?"
"355.2"," So now that you know how to create a data frame using a series, next we'll see how we"
"359.04"," can create a data frame out of a NumPy array."
"361.84000000000003"," Okay?"
"362.84000000000003"," So let's see how."
"363.84000000000003"," So here creating data frame using a NumPy array."
"371.28000000000003"," Okay?"
"372.28000000000003"," So here the very first thing that I'll do is import my NumPy library."
"377.32"," So import NumPy as nb."
"381.4"," Since I have already imported pandas up there so I don't need to import it again."
"385.88"," So after importing the libraries next what I'll do I'll define my NumPy array."
"391.28"," So let's say my NumPy array equals np dot array and inside this let's have some salary"
"401.23999999999995"," value like 1060 thousand let's say these are the salary of employee whose names are let's"
"409.03999999999996"," say John."
"411.04"," James."
"412.04"," Okay?"
"413.04"," So now that I have defined my NumPy array let me just create a data frame out of it."
"418.08000000000004"," So data frame df equal pd dot data frame."
"425.68"," So let's add a name of the employees over here."
"428.52000000000004"," So name and the self fetch data from NumPy array with cell for cell."
"436.0"," Okay?"
"437.0"," And next let's define salary."
"439.52"," So salary will fetch data from NumPy array 0th index."
"445.76"," So my data frame is created."
"447.84"," Now let's just print it."
"449.71999999999997"," Execute it data type not understood."
"453.12"," Okay?"
"454.12"," So I've missed this opening and closing square bracket over here."
"458.08"," That's why I'm getting this arrow."
"459.56"," Let's execute it."
"460.56"," Okay?"
"461.56"," Let's resolve it."
"462.56"," So here you are just created a data frame out of a NumPy array with column name as a"
"467.0"," name, salary and has the index number 0 and 1."
"471.32"," Okay?"
