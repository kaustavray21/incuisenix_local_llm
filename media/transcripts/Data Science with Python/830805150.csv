"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome back to Python certification course."
"9.36"," In our previous session we saw what are the various types of machine learning and we also"
"13.32"," saw what are the various real life use cases for them."
"16.32"," Right, I hope those things are clear to you."
"18.84"," So, today's session is on what you can do with machine learning."
"22.92"," In today's session you will see what type of question you can ask your machine with,"
"27.92"," classification algorithm, anomaly detection algorithm, clustering algorithm and regression"
"33.04"," algorithm."
"34.440000000000005"," I hope the agenda is cleared you guys."
"36.88"," So without delaying any further, let's start with what type of question you can ask"
"40.96"," your machine."
"42.760000000000005"," Well, you can get answers of these questions like what types of house lights in this segment"
"47.68000000000001"," or what is the market value of this house or is this male spam or not spam or is there"
"52.8"," any fraud and this transaction."
"54.52"," So all of these kind of question comes up under the category of machine learning."
"58.52"," So let's move on ahead and see some of the machine learning algorithm and what type of"
"62.92"," algorithm can deal with these kind of question."
"66.12"," So on first we have classification algorithm."
"68.80000000000001"," So using classification algorithm you can predict a category using the data."
"72.88"," For example, as this person a male or female or as this male a spam or not spam."
"78.12"," So these type of question it comes under classification algorithm."
"82.0"," Or is it going to rain tomorrow or not."
"84.16"," So all these type of question comes under classification algorithm."
"89.08"," Next is anomaly detection algorithm."
"91.6"," It is generally used to identify unusual data points."
"94.75999999999999"," For example, is there any fraud and this transaction or is someone trying to hack our network."
"99.84"," So these kind of question comes under anomaly detection algorithm."
"105.32"," Next is the clustering algorithm."
"107.24"," Well clustering algorithm groups the data based on some condition like which type of house"
"112.36"," lies in the segment or what type of customer generally buys this product recommendation engine."
"117.96"," Right."
"118.96"," So these type of question comes under clustering algorithm."
"122.76"," Next is a regression algorithm."
"124.68"," Well this is used to group data based on some condition like what is the market value"
"129.36"," of this house or is it going to rain tomorrow."
"132.44"," So these were some of the various machine learning algorithms."
"136.76"," Next we have machine learning for you."
"138.44"," There are few links which you can just go out and see some cool machine learning projects you can use."
