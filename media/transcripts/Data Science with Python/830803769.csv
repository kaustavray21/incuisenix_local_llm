"0.0"," Hello everyone. In this session, we are going to focus on basic statistic constructs that"
"10.08"," form a descriptive approach to define the data. So let's quickly take a look at the agenda"
"15.200000000000001"," for this session. So we want to start with the basic introduction to statistics and moving"
"19.52"," further, we are going to discuss the importance of statistics in data science. And then we"
"24.16"," will cover the various concepts like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, etc."
"30.96"," So let's go ahead and discuss statistics in data science."
"35.76"," So what is statistics? Statistics in a nutshell is the study of data"
"40.879999999999995"," where mathematical calculations are used to create assumptions that are backed by statistical"
"46.32"," evidence and help in understanding the data better. To understand to which extent the analysis"
"52.8"," can be beneficial, let's understand how data science is driven by statistics in real world scenario."
"61.839999999999996"," Data science is nothing but a fancy term that incorporates advanced statistical techniques that"
"67.52"," draw rigid insights and conclusions about your data. Used in predictive analytics,"
"72.96"," in machine learning algorithms, the basic idea is maximizing the potential of a statistical"
"78.32"," problem and quantifying the same in terms of data science. Statistics being the core of any"
"84.39999999999999"," machine learning algorithm, it helps in identifying the trends and patterns in the data for further"
"90.08"," analysis. Statistics goes on to help in feature selection, for model building and feature engineering"
"96.47999999999999"," as well. And these are just some of the ways statistics has shaped the data science ecosystem."
"103.12"," Now let's go ahead and learn a few basic statistical measures that define the data."
"110.4"," So first of all we have the mean. So what exactly is the mean of any data?"
"115.44000000000001"," Mean of any given samples is nothing but the average value of the sample."
"120.24000000000001"," The mean is calculated by adding all the sample values or summing all the sample values and"
"126.8"," dividing the same with the number of observations in the given sample. In Python,"
"132.24"," NumPy and statistics modules provide a simple function that will calculate the mean of the sample"
"138.0"," as shown in the example. Here we have a sample which has the numbers 1, 4, 2, 6, 8, 3, 1, 5, 7,"
"145.35999999999999"," and 9. So to calculate the mean we are just using this function which is on the back end,"
"151.04"," summing up all the values and dividing the same with the number of samples. So that is why we are"
"155.28"," getting the sum all the mean as 4.6. And that is all about the mean of the data. Let's move on to"
"162.48"," the median. So coming to the median of the data the median is nothing but the middle value of the"
"168.8"," data. In the example shown here we have 10 observations in the sample and we will measure the median"
"175.76"," by putting the formula to work where the sum of the fourth and fifth element of the sample in a"
"180.8"," sorted setting will be added and divided by 2. Otherwise if the number of observations were"
"187.76000000000002"," odd the median value would have been n plus 1 divided by 2 which is going to be 11 plus 1 that is"
"194.48000000000002"," 12 by 2 that is the sixth position in a sorted setting over here. And in this case if the observations"
"201.04000000000002"," let's say for example over 11 the median would have been the sixth element in the sorted sample."
"206.48000000000002"," In our case it would have been 5 I think. So now we will move on to the third concept over here"
"212.72"," which is the mode of the data. So when it comes to the mode of the sample mode is nothing but"
"218.24"," the most occurring value in the sample. For example if a sample had 1 occurring the most number of"
"224.64000000000001"," times the mode of the sample will be 1. As you can see over here in that example. Let's say we had"
"230.72"," 4 written 3 times over there in the sample the mode would have become 4 over here."
"236.0"," And when you say if we have a distinct sample where all the sample values are distinct observations"
"242.0"," the more of the sample will not be defined and will not exist. And now that we are done with"
"247.67999999999998"," main median and mode which are basically the central tendencies of any data when we describe it in"
"252.79999999999998"," any problem for for example for exploratory data analysis or for any statistical problem"
"258.96"," mean median and mode will give us the central tendencies of our data or the sample."
"264.88"," And now that we are done with these let's go ahead and learn about variance and standard deviation."
"270.56"," So when we talk about variance in simple terms variance is nothing but a measure of how far"
"275.76"," the data point lies from the mean of the sample or population. To calculate the variance of a sample"
"281.92"," we will follow the formula shown in the picture over here that we can see to calculate the variance"
"288.16"," we will subtract sample mean from the actual value and divide it from the number of observations"
"293.12"," in the sample. The square and we are going to square the outcome and we will perform this for"
"298.96"," all the values. So that is how we calculate the variance of any sample. Now coming back to"
"306.16"," standard deviation when it comes to standard deviation it is calculated by computing the square"
"311.44"," root of the variance. It also gives the estimation of how far the data is dispersed from the sample"
"317.36"," or population mean. But the difference between variance and standard deviation is that the standard"
"323.36"," deviation is calculated in the same unit as original values. Therefore it can give us a more"
"329.44"," rigid explanation of how the spread of the data is distributed. So when we have to check the spread"
"335.12"," of the data we make use of standard deviation and variance. So for central tendencies we are using"
"341.2"," a mean median and mode for the spread of the data we are checking standard deviation and variance."
"346.32"," So these are two measures that are used in any statistical analysis for our data or any sample or"
"351.59999999999997"," population. Now let's quickly take a look at an example where we calculate variance and standard"
"357.68"," deviation using Python program. So from statistics module we have the same sample again and we are"
"362.96"," calculating the variance using sample or statistics dot sample you can and we are calculating the variance"
"368.64"," using the variance method over here and that is giving us the value 8.26 and so on. Now if a square"
"375.76"," root the same value we are going to get the standard deviation which is 2.87. So that is how you"
"380.96"," calculate the standard deviation and variance for any sample. And now that we are done with the"
"386.64"," basic statistical concepts let's go on and learn about sampling techniques for further computations."
"391.92"," More of that in the next session thanks for watching the ESC keyplorning."
