"0.0"," Hello guys and welcome all to this Python certification course."
"8.32"," In our previous session we learned about NumPy, Indexing and Slicing."
"12.36"," I hope all the things are clear to you."
"14.48"," In case you have any doubt feel free to reach out in telepath 24-7 and we'll try to resolve"
"19.240000000000002"," your query at the earliest."
"20.92"," So this was about the last session."
"22.72"," In our today's session we are going to learn about Array Manipulation in Python."
"28.64"," So as a part of Array Manipulation we have concatenating two arrays together."
"33.88"," Stack array, row wise, vertically, stack array, column wise, horizontally and combining column"
"39.68"," wise stack array."
"40.68"," Let's take an example and jump at an notebook and learn them one by one."
"44.8"," So here we are going to start about Array Manipulation Python."
"51.64"," So first of all let's define two arrays."
"54.28"," Let's take a equal np dot array inside this."
"58.92"," Let's say one, two, three."
"61.08"," Okay, so this is my array and b equal np dot array for five and six."
"67.2"," Okay, so first of all we'll see how we can concatenate these two arrays."
"72.12"," So first is concatenation of two arrays."
"77.16"," So for this we have a function concatenate under NumPy."
"80.44"," So we'll just call it np dot concatenate."
"83.6"," I'll just write a and b."
"86.64"," Let's say."
"87.64"," So here you've got the output as one, two, three, four, five, six in a all the element"
"91.72"," in a single array."
"92.72"," So therefore what did it concatenated both the array a and b into one."
"97.28"," Okay, so next we have is stack array row wise."
"100.75999999999999"," That is vertically."
"101.75999999999999"," So stack array row wise vertically."
"106.16"," Okay, so again for this we have another function in NumPy."
"110.44000000000001"," As we stack, so just take two parameters, the name of two arrays a and b executed."
"115.84"," So as you can see, my two arrays are stacked whenever other vertically."
"121.16000000000001"," Here one more thing I have to say like if you want to stack array row wise,"
"128.84"," but in a horizontal fashion."
"131.36"," So it's again same as your concatenate function, but here we have another function as et"
"136.28"," stack and even the stakes two parameter a and b and it's quite similar to the concatenate"
"141.92"," function."
"142.92000000000002"," It'll give you the same result."
"143.92000000000002"," Okay, so this was about et stack."
"146.08"," So till now we discuss about concatenating or stacking row wise."
"150.04"," Right."
"151.04"," Now what if I have to combine column wise."
"153.08"," So let's see here combining column wise."
"157.52"," So for this I have a NumPy function column underscore stack."
"161.52"," So let's call it np dot column underscore stack inside."
"166.28"," So let's pass our arrays a and b executed."
"170.24"," So here you can see that my array a and b are stacked in a column in a fashion."
"176.04000000000002"," Okay."
"177.04000000000002"," So this was about combining column wise stack array."
"179.84"," Okay."
"180.84"," So let's get back to our BBD and see what is the next topic."
"184.20000000000002"," So next topic in array manipulation and Python we have a splitting array."
"188.28"," That is what if we want to perform some horizontal split or vertical split in the array."
"193.04000000000002"," Let's see how to do it."
"197.24"," So for this let's define an array."
"201.04000000000002"," Let's take x equal np dot arrange 16 numbers and reshape this one."
"207.56"," D array in the dimension of four cross four."
"210.08"," Okay."
"211.08"," Let's print x and CR array."
"213.56"," So this is our four cross four array consisting of numbers between zero to 16."
"218.16000000000003"," Now what if I want to split my array horizontally from here at this point."
"222.04"," So that my first array contains zero one four five eight nine twelve thirteen and my"
"226.28"," next array contains two three six seven ten eleven and fourteen fifteen."
"230.28"," Let's see how to do it."
"231.28"," Well for this we have another function as it's split."
"234.23999999999998"," Let me just show you print np dot it's split inside this."
"239.28"," You have to pass your array and define from which position you want to split."
"244.0"," I want to split it from second like this is my zero tenth index first index my second"
"249.28"," index."
"250.28"," So I want to perform a split from this point."
"252.88"," Okay."
"253.88"," So let's see the output."
"254.88"," Let me make things more clear for you."
"257.24"," Let's add a new line up here on zondel's split performing this split."
"263.92"," So here you can see that I have two arrays."
"266.8"," First array is this consisting of zero one four five eight nine and twelve."
"271.68"," And my next plated array consists of the rest half that is two three six seven ten eleven"
"276.64"," and fourteen forty."
"277.64"," Okay."
"278.64"," So let's see what's the output."
"280.64"," But before this let's add some new line."
"282.64"," Let's check the output."
"285.64"," So here we got two arrays."
"288.64"," Right."
"289.64"," First one is this zero one two four five six seven eight nine."
"293.64"," So let's see what's the output."
"295.64"," But before this let's add some new line."
"299.64"," Let's check the output."
"301.64"," So here we got two arrays."
"304.64"," Right."
"305.64"," Okay."
"306.64"," So here let's split it from this point."
"307.64"," So as that zero one two four five six eight nine ten all are these and so all of them"
"312.64"," are in one array."
"313.64"," And a rest of them that is three seven eleven fifteen is in different array."
"316.64"," Okay."
"317.64"," So let's do it."
"318.64"," Np dot horizontal split."
"319.64"," And let's try it X comma, Np dot array."
"320.64"," Okay."
"321.64"," them that is 371115 is in different array. Okay, so let's do it np dot horizontal split and"
"330.52"," let's try it x comma np dot array. So here you will get the output as this. Okay, now from this"
"340.68"," example, what if I want these two columns together and this entire column has a separate array. So"
"346.84"," I want three arrays in total. So I just have to make a little change in it. Just try two comma three."
"352.84"," That's it. It's like np dot it's split x comma np dot array second and third column. So here"
"359.15999999999997"," I got the output as this. This is my first array. This is my second array and this is my third array."
"365.79999999999995"," Okay, so guys, this was all about splitting arrays and array manipulation and Python."
