"659.26"," you"
"689.26"," you"
"719.26"," okay, so I hope let's start now let me share my screen and if it is visible, you can just ping in the chat."
"741.26"," guys can you see my screen?"
"743.26"," so yesterday we are we have covered until our HTML tags and attributes right so now we can just start with our HTML headings, okay, so once we are covering the image topics, I will also show you how to add more Q over the image data as well, okay, so yes,"
"762.26"," yeah, so let's start now so we will be seeing our HTML headings so heading is nothing but so whenever I'm going to display because rather than text or rather than a passage, we need to have some boldings in our heading right so that we will be calling us a heading tag."
"782.26"," So in HTML we will be having nearly six heading tags, okay, so our HTML tag will start from H1 so which is very very bold and it will be until H6 so until this we can choose what would be our heading so if you want to make it as a main heading, you can go for heading one."
"806.26"," So if it is like if you want to go for a sub heading or if you want to have another one heading below that you can just go with H2 H3 tag as well right so most probably in our HTML will be based like using our heading tag so what is the use of heading tag means by default it will be bolder and it will be in big size."
"827.26"," We doesn't need to give any font size that is we know need to give what would be the font size or whether it must be bold or italic like that we doesn't need to give any property for this heading tag which is need to use H1 or H2, okay, so that's the reason in HTML we use H2 to tell the web browser that the text that is inside the tag is to be displayed as a heading or not because basically we will be having list of codes right so in case you can even."
"857.26"," Just check to the Wikipedia so if you are having means only heading tag it will be bolded right other paragraph it will not be bolded so in order to work on we will be having two different tags one is our heading tag which will be using only for headings or subheadings and the another one would be over paragraph tag which will be given so that is for our paragraph or passage okay."
"882.26"," So here as I said our HTML tag will be having six tags so H1 is the most big that is it will be in bigger size and H6 it will be in smaller size so it is in the decreasing order it will be very bolder and it will be very big and it keeps on decreasing its size so that's the reason it is referred we will be having six heading tag winner HTML."
"906.26"," Okay so yeah so as I say H1 it is for the title of the blog or if you're going to display any blog or article so what is going to be the main heading you will be using your H1 tag because it will be very bolder and the first is like subheading we can choose any one of your heading tag and so as it said H6 it is going to be least and we can use it for our note or any reader format also we can use our H6."
"936.26"," Okay so another one more important thing is so whenever we are going to use the HTML tags so we can like we will be having our bold tag also I will show you what is bold tag or what is italic tag so we need not to use always this bold and italic tag so if it is going to be your heading tag."
"966.26"," So what you will be using is only you will be using your heading tag you will not use big bold or italic or any other like that you will not use so here that is what it is mentioned whenever you're going to use any heading you will be using only your heading tag or not the bold attack okay so now let's see some of the example for heading and"
"986.26"," sorry I'll just show you what is the bold italic tag as well as I will show you the heading tags okay so let us have here anyone of the heading so as I said what are the values which we will be having it must be onely inside our body tag right so yesterday we saw until this we have just we are just running our sample the page and we just added one text and one hyperlink and we are just crawling this text right so this is the one that we are going to use is a"
"1015.26"," text right so this is what we saw yesterday so now instead of this so let me have general mark you and here here we can see it would be in smaller size which is the default size right so here welcome to my page it is in default size so now I'm going to use heading tag over here okay so I can specify what type of heading or how much bigger small I want so here what I'm going to use is I'm going to use my H1 tag"
"1045.26"," so as I said H1 is going to be very very big and you can use only till H6 tag it starts from H1 and instil H6 so let us have H1 tag over here so as I said what are the tag you're opening you must close that"
"1061.7"," tag okay so as we're using inside the mark you so I'm just I just want welcome to my the page all in very bolder format so only for this I'm passing my H1"
"1073.22"," tag and I'm closing my H1 tag okay so now let's say this and go back and run this here you can see right it is bold my heading format it"
"1084.94"," doesn't big size now it is not in my default web page text it's time it doesn't big size right so this is what we'll be doing in our heading tag"
"1095.3400000000001"," so this is our H1 and also I will show you the H6 so let us have this hyperlink that is Amazon hyperlink as a H5 tag so we'll get some"
"1107.3"," difference so I'm just going to use H5 so that it would be in small format okay so let's run this okay can you see it does in our heading here you can see it is automatically bolder or to make it more clear let's have H3 tag"
"1126.3"," because it would be somewhat big in size let's have H3 tag and if I'm going to refresh this here can you see the difference basically heading tag will have bold function in"
"1139.1"," build to it we need not to give any bold over there it will be automatically heading tag will be bolder okay so we'll be having six heading tags it starts from H1 and"
"1151.1"," still H6 so H6 it would be very very least at H1 it will be bigger in size so is there any doubts regarding the heading tag wise if there is any doubt please"
"1162.16"," ping in the chat alright yes she know okay so now let's go with the yeah so I'll just I said right I will show you what is bold and what is"
"1187.96"," italic also so apart from this we will be having some other tag also so that we will be calling it as so we will be having our bold tag so we will be using the with this for our bold okay so whenever I'm going to give any text inside my beat"
"1206.76"," and it will be in bolder format okay this is what we call it as bold so this if you want to give any bolding format because in our web page you might be seeing right so if it's like any particular single word it must be"
"1220.76"," highlighted we can use a bold tag okay and if you want that to be italic you can use I so I is nothing but it is a italic okay so my text will appear as italic so if you want both bold and italic means"
"1235.76"," italic means at that time you can open your bold tag and also you can open your italic tag you can pass your text okay bold italic and you can close both of your tag okay so both the tag so if it is I like you can close any tag at first but the thing is you should make sure you are closing your tag okay so this is what we will be calling it as bold italic and apart from this we will be also having"
"1264.76"," underlying tags okay so if I'm going to use you so whatever value I'm going to pass inside it will be underlined okay so and I will be using my slash tag also so these are the other tags apart from heading we will be having so we can use these tags also if your text wants to be bold and italic you can use bold and italic and if it wants to be underlined we can also use"
"1290.76"," also use underlying tags I'll also show you some examples so let's have in our webpage itself so here let's add some body so inside this body let's take some other values and I don't want this to be in center so what I will give so let me give"
"1314.76"," you hi there is my HTML session so if it is going to be high use my HTML session and I want only my HTML to be in bolded format I can use beta okay I will just beta go over here and only my HTML must be bolded so I will end over here okay slash"
"1340.36"," so this means only this particular HTML it will be bolded so others it will be in normal text so let's run this can you see now we are having a text over here and hi this is my HTML session only HTML is bolded right same in case if you want to"
"1362.2"," underline this same what we need to do is we will be using our underline tag or we will be using our italic tag so let's have that so let us have both or the entire text must be in italic format okay so I will just pass"
"1378.68"," within entire message okay so now everything it will be in italic and HTML it will be in bold italic and if you want to underline this session we can use underline tag over here we can use"
"1391.56"," Utah and we just need to end over Utah okay so now it means so we will be having like enter text as italic format and HTML is with bold and italic because we are passing italic to"
"1405.56"," interior so it will be like consider this bold and italic and we will be having our session so it will be italic and also this text will be underlined so now let's run this"
"1417.3200000000002"," so if I'm going to refresh here you can see right so my entire text will be italic format and this I'm just passing bold over here so it will have both the property bold as well as italic and here my session will be in underline format so this is how we will be using the other"
"1436.92"," text which is bold and we will be having italic tag and also we will be having our underline tag okay so guys is this clear or do you want me to explain another one more time"
"1456.68"," okay so yeah hope it's clear so yeah now let me show you so after this so here you can see right so it is like taking the default"
"1466.52"," font size so it might be calibrary or it might be anything so it is taking the default size right so consider if we want to set our own font size how can we do that so it is like still it is possible to pass our own text format"
"1481.96"," so for that we will be using another one tag which we will be naming that as a font so let it be so I'll just make a copy of this"
"1491.64"," so so and another one more thing if you're just keep on going to pass this it will be like I'll just pass this it"
"1498.44"," will not be in a next line it will consider it in a single line okay so if you're just passing"
"1503.88"," without anything it will be in a same line can you see but it must not be in a same line I just want"
"1509.88"," this to print in my next line right so because it is not taking a next it is just passing in a single"
"1516.1200000000001"," text itself for this we will be using another one tag which is we call it as break tag okay so that what it will be like as the name itself it indicates we will be using as"
"1527.96"," BR okay so I will be using BR tag so this tag we need not to close this because without closing also it will work so it is nothing but break"
"1540.3600000000001"," so only tag which will which we will not close is break tag but if we are closing this also no no issues okay so this break tag will leave one break which is like one end"
"1551.08"," there okay so this break tag will leave one space in our format okay so now let's consider I just want this to be in a separate separate line okay I just don't want to be in a single line so what I will do I will just pass a break tag over here so after the sentence is"
"1569.88"," going to complete it will just hit one end of your space over here and in a next line I will get another one so let's do need to add all the tags over here so let it be a simple text okay so I'm just going to pass this"
"1587.24"," okay so just give me a moment okay so now if I'm going to refresh can you see the difference it isn't next to the line so if you want to give another one enter you can just pass another one break so that it will be like it will give to enter of space and we will get it over here"
"1615.24"," so if I want another one space I can just give another one break condition or break tag over here I will save this and I will go back and if I'm going to run it will leave another one space so this is how we will be giving space or enter in our text in the format of tag we will be using our break tag which will break the sentence like it will just do one end select it's similar to one enter however we present enough to you it will just give a enter and it will be using it."
"1643.24"," it will just give an enter and it will be displaying in the next line."
"1647.08"," It just breaks the sentence to be like if you are going to have one length sentence,"
"1653.48"," we can just break that sentence into two to three parts."
"1656.56"," So that is what we will be using break tag."
"1659.1200000000001"," Now, if I want to change my font style over here."
"1663.04"," So how I can do that means what I will do will be having another one option called font."
"1669.48"," Okay, so we will be having font tag."
"1674.48"," So I will open my font tag."
"1676.64"," So what are these styles you want to give?"
"1679.4"," You can go and give it inside this font tag."
"1682.72"," I will just specify my font face."
"1685.28"," Okay, so here you need to specify equal to and I would suggest always just copy paste your"
"1690.8"," font style."
"1691.8"," Okay, so if I want to paste or if I want to go and use different font, you just go to my"
"1697.32"," font and I will just copy my font style."
"1701.48"," Okay, so let's have this."
"1705.48"," Okay, I will just copy my font and I will just paste it over here."
"1711.0"," I will close."
"1712.24"," I will close my font style."
"1714.08"," Sorry font tag."
"1715.6799999999998"," So font and you need to give your face."
"1718.1599999999999"," Okay, font face describes which is the style of font which you are going to give."
"1722.8"," So once after this, you need to close your font."
"1725.68"," So until before you're closing, if it is like three lines, five lines."
"1729.96"," So until this file ends, you will get this font face or what is the font you are going"
"1734.6000000000001"," to specify."
"1735.6000000000001"," It will be there."
"1737.52"," Now let's run this."
"1739.3600000000001"," So if I'm going to refresh this, only this text will be in my different because I'm using"
"1744.76"," a font property that is I'm using a font face that is font tag."
"1750.04"," So inside that font tag, I'm just passing like what is the style of my font I want."
"1755.76"," Right, you can just pass any font, but make sure you're copy wasting because in case"
"1759.8799999999999"," if you are typing, if the character is mismatching, we will not get the exact font."
"1764.68"," So make sure you're just either copy wasting from your world or you're just copy wasting"
"1769.28"," from your mode pack."
"1770.28"," You will get your font over here."
"1772.6"," Okay, so this is how we will be creating different styles of font or we'll be using bold"
"1777.72"," italic underline also."
"1779.56"," So here also you can just pass or you can make it bolder italic, but the thing is whenever"
"1784.6399999999999"," you're going to open any tag, you need to close your tag."
"1788.3999999999999"," That's the main thing."
"1789.72"," Okay, so yes, guys, any doubts on this?"
"1810.04"," Okay, all right, let's go with a ppt."
"1813.6399999999999"," So now we have done with our like headings and we also saw some other new fonts with"
"1818.56"," result by bold italic underline and how to set the font."
"1822.9199999999998"," So now let's see how we will be using our paragraph tag."
"1826.56"," So as I said, what would be the difference between paragraph tag and what would be like"
"1830.96"," we will be having two types."
"1832.72"," One would be my paragraph."
"1834.56"," Okay, I will be having paragraph tag."
"1839.2"," And I will be having a pre tag."
"1842.2"," Okay, so this paragraph, if I'm going to specify it will be mentioned as p tag."
"1848.2"," Okay, so if I'm going to specify p, it will be considered as p tag."
"1853.2"," Okay, what would be the difference means?"
"1856.2"," So consider if I'm going to give a text or if I'm going to copy paste and by default or"
"1862.2"," mistakenly, if I'm giving empty spaces over here means."
"1865.2"," So if I'm going to pass this inside my p tag, what my browser will do means my browser"
"1871.2"," will like ignore all the empty spaces, right?"
"1874.2"," So in the place of one space, if I mistakenly give two to three spaces means it will be automatically"
"1880.2"," corrected and it will consider that one space."
"1883.2"," So that is the importance of paragraph."
"1885.2"," So the browser will correct, but in the case of pre tag, so even if I'm going to leave"
"1891.2"," three spaces, it will print as such."
"1894.2"," Okay, so why this pre tag or when this pre tag will be used means so considered if I'm"
"1899.2"," going to create any forms or any application forms which will available in our website."
"1906.2"," So in that website, I will be having certain spaces, right?"
"1909.2"," So if I want to have any buttons or after that button, if I want to give to two three"
"1914.2"," spaces means at that time, we can use this pre tag."
"1917.2"," The tag mainly will use enough forms."
"1920.2"," Okay, so it will just specify where the text box must be there or where the label must be there"
"1926.2"," because it will not change."
"1928.2"," So whenever or what are the things which we are going to pass inside the pre tag, it will"
"1932.2"," remind as such so that is the use of pre tag and this could be the difference between paragraph"
"1937.2"," and p tag."
"1938.2"," So here it will be ignoring the extra spaces here, it will not ignore people just printed as such."
"1946.2"," Okay, so now."
"1949.2"," So let's see the difference."
"1951.2"," So as I said, HTMLP is used to display block of text and that starts on the new line."
"1958.2"," So here whenever you are just going to copy paste."
"1961.2"," So what are the value you are just copy pasting?"
"1963.2"," It will be considered as a paragraph."
"1965.2"," It will not just split in between."
"1967.2"," But then if you want to use any like break statement inside that inside p tag,"
"1972.2"," you can still use your break tag."
"1975.2"," Okay, so here here there is an example."
"1977.2"," So if you are going to give inside this paragraph time, you will get a expected result as this."
"1982.2"," Like it will just ignore and it will just print as such."
"1986.2"," And when it comes to as I said, paragraph will be passing inside our p tag."
"1993.2"," So one like you can just start your p tag and you can give up lines of text which you want to give."
"1999.2"," It can be 10 lines front lines 50 lines."
"2002.2"," And when it when you are going to end your paragraph, you need to close your p tag."
"2007.2"," Okay, so this is what will be the data and as I said, that is a difference between p and paragraph."
"2013.2"," Sorry, p tag and 3."
"2015.2"," So what this pre tag rules like in case if my text is going to be in this format that is without any space."
"2021.2"," So if I'm using p tag, it will just ignore all my empty spaces and I will get only the same result."
"2028.2"," In case if I'm going to use pre tag, so whatever value I'm going to give as such, it will print in my pre tag."
"2034.2"," So that would be the difference between p tag and pre tag."
"2039.2"," Okay, so let's see some examples for this."
"2046.2"," So let me copy from any website or even from Intel, but I'll just open."
"2054.2"," Okay, so I'm just going to copy any one of the passage."
"2067.2"," Okay, so let me copy this."
"2069.2"," So this is in a format of paragraph, right?"
"2071.2"," So I can just copy any paragraph."
"2073.2"," If it is going to be a big, also I can just copy that."
"2077.2"," And I'll just paste it in my page."
"2084.2"," Even for paragraph, you can use this font."
"2088.2"," Okay, so if I want my paragraph to be in this font, I can just put it over here."
"2093.2"," I will open my p tag, which is my paragraph tag and I will paste my entire text."
"2098.2"," So once this text has been entered, I will close my paragraph tag."
"2104.2"," Okay, so here you can see or let me have some spaces over here."
"2109.2"," Okay, so I will just add some extra spaces over here."
"2112.2"," So let's see whether this space is reflecting in my paragraph or not."
"2116.2"," If I'm going to copy this and if I'm going to run over here."
"2126.2"," So let us refresh this page."
"2128.2"," Here you can see, right?"
"2129.2"," So I have just left some spaces over here near machine learning and artificial intelligence."
"2134.2"," But as it is a paragraph tag, it is ignoring the empty spaces and it is just displaying in a format of paragraph."
"2141.2"," Right, so it is just ignoring."
"2143.2"," So in this case, if I'm going to use pre tag over here, it will not ignore these spaces."
"2149.2"," It will just give as such."
"2151.2"," So here if it is space means I will get a space in my browser as well."
"2156.2"," If I'm going to refresh this, can you see the difference over here?"
"2160.2"," Because pre tag will never skip this empty spaces."
"2164.2"," It will just print as such, but paragraph tag will just understand this and it will give or it will just."
"2170.2"," Remove all those spaces so that would be the difference between our pre tag and paragraph tag."
"2177.2"," Okay, so yes, there is any other doubts regarding p tag or paragraph tag."
"2182.2"," If you are having any doubts, please feel free to ask your doubts or share your queries."
"2200.2"," Yes, there is any doubts?"
"2207.2"," Mono and she know."
"2210.2"," Okay, it's clear, right?"
"2212.2"," So if you're having any doubts, just stop me and you can just ask your queries, no, just."
"2219.2"," Okay, so now let's see with the link."
"2222.2"," Okay, so we will be having two types of link as I saw."
"2225.2"," Like yesterday, we saw one external link, right?"
"2227.2"," So we will be having two types of link in our HTML."
"2230.2"," So one would be our internal link, okay, which is like inside our paragraph, one would be our internal links and another one would be our external links."
"2240.2"," Okay, so external yesterday we are like we have did some navigation to Amazon, right?"
"2246.2"," That we call it as external link."
"2248.2"," It will not be navigated within its page."
"2251.2"," It will just navigate to the next page."
"2254.2"," So that we call it as external link from one page to the another page that we call it as external link."
"2261.2"," So when it comes to internal link, it will just navigate within my page, navigate inside its own page."
"2271.2"," Okay, so it will just navigate inside its own page."
"2274.2"," Whereas external link, it will not navigate inside its own page."
"2279.2"," It will just go to the next page."
"2283.2"," So this is what we will be having are we saw yesterday."
"2286.2"," So yesterday what we saw is external link that is we just passed when inside our H reference and we just from our web page."
"2293.2"," We just navigated to the another one, which is our Amazon."
"2297.2"," Now we'll just see what would be the instant like internal link."
"2301.2"," Okay, so why internal link is used means to consider it if you're just having a number of or thousand lines of text and it will be just crawling down and you will be seeing or reading the article."
"2314.2"," But suddenly if you want to go on see the top article, we cannot just go back."
"2319.2"," Right, so again, you need to scroll back."
"2321.2"," So what this internal link will do."
"2323.2"," So if I want to go to the top, if I'm pressing this link automatically, it will navigate to the top of the page."
"2330.2"," So same if I want to go to the end, it will just from my from my link, if I'm clicking it will just navigate to the bottom of the page."
"2339.2"," So that is the use of navigation."
"2341.2"," Okay, so I'll just show you and let's see the PPT."
"2346.2"," Okay, so first let me show you."
"2350.2"," So let us just copy this text so that it would be easy for us to just check with the internal and external."
"2359.2"," I'll just copy this."
"2365.2"," Okay, entire I'm just copying but I'm not going to paste it inside my phone."
"2370.2"," So I'm just going to paste it down."
"2374.2"," Okay, so this would be like I will be having more text."
"2378.2"," So it looks like my it will be enough for my out of the page, right?"
"2383.2"," So considered if I'm going to have more than this or if I'm going to have a number of values or number of lines over here."
"2390.2"," So when I'm viewing here, suddenly if I want to go to down."
"2394.2"," So at that time, we need a link to navigate right inside our page."
"2398.2"," So that would be the use of internal link."
"2401.2"," Okay, so let me take this as well."
"2408.2"," Okay, I'll just pass this two times so that it would be still."
"2418.2"," We're having fixed over here."
"2426.2"," Okay, if I'm going to refresh so here you can see I'm getting a scroll."
"2430.2"," So it is like not only one scroll."
"2432.2"," So in case if I'm going to have thousands or like number of lines, I will be keep on scrolling."
"2437.2"," So at that time, so manually, we need to scroll down or scroll up."
"2441.2"," So if I'm going to pass my link over here."
"2444.2"," So whenever I'm going to press my link, it will automatically maybe get me to down or it will automatically take me to down."
"2450.2"," So that's the reason we will be using our internal link."
"2453.2"," So same."
"2454.2"," So for using our internal link, we'll be using our attack, which is our anchor tag, one."
"2459.2"," Lee."
"2460.2"," So inside our anchor tag will be passing our values over there."
"2464.2"," So consider so in my body, I will just give it over here."
"2468.2"," Okay, after my module, I just need to have my link over here."
"2473.2"," So what I will do, I will just pass my anchor tag."
"2476.2"," I will just pass my a hits reference."
"2478.2"," So here we need to pass a hash value over here."
"2482.2"," So this would be your ID."
"2485.2"," Okay, so this would be our ID."
"2487.2"," We just need to give any name for our internal link."
"2490.2"," So let me take us internal."
"2492.2"," Okay, so it will just check for its ID and I will pass my link over here, my internal link."
"2500.2"," Okay, so this would be my link hyperlink."
"2503.2"," So what is the hyperlink that I'm going to give us my internal link?"
"2507.2"," So this would be like underline and it will be in a format of hyperlink."
"2512.2"," So now I will close my anchor tag."
"2514.2"," Right."
"2515.2"," So once after my closing my anchor tag, so I have specified my link."
"2519.2"," Right, but it needs to refer to some other point."
"2522.2"," So what I will do, so where it needs to take me, it needs to take me to here."
"2528.2"," Right."
"2529.2"," So again, I will pass."
"2531.2"," So anchor, I will just pass my ID."
"2534.2"," Okay, so what is my ID?"
"2536.2"," My ID is internal."
"2537.2"," Okay, and I will close my tag."
"2540.2"," So what it will do."
"2541.2"," So if it is going to be internal, when I'm going to click that link, it needs to take to me in this place."
"2548.2"," So that's the reason I'm passing ID over here."
"2551.2"," I'll just save this and I need to run over here."
"2555.2"," Okay."
"2556.2"," So here you can see right, I'm having a link over here."
"2560.2"," So it is in a hyperlink format."
"2562.2"," So when I'm going to click this link, it needs to take me down."
"2566.2"," Right, it is taking me down."
"2567.2"," Right."
"2568.2"," So if I'm going to click this, it will automatically take me down."
"2571.2"," So the thing to notice is external link is very easy, but internal link it will be somewhat confusing."
"2577.2"," But your format would be like I will just show you."
"2582.2"," So whenever you're going to pass your internal link."
"2585.2"," So the place where you're going to give your link, you need to pass your anchor tag and you need to pass your reference link over here."
"2593.2"," So here the whatever value you're going to hit you, it must be followed by here has."
"2599.2"," Okay, so it can be any name."
"2601.2"," What are the value you're going to give?"
"2603.2"," So make sure it must be similar to your ID link."
"2606.2"," Okay, so this is basically the ID need."
"2609.2"," Okay, I'll pass my ID name and after that I will just give what is my hyperlink."
"2615.2"," So here is where we'll get the hyperlink text."
"2619.2"," Okay, so once this hyperlink text is done, I just need to close my anchor tag."
"2624.2"," I will close my anchor tag."
"2626.2"," Right."
"2627.2"," So now it will become a hyperlink."
"2629.2"," So when I'm clicking this, it needs to take me to somewhere."
"2632.2"," Right."
"2633.2"," So where you want this page to go, you just need to go down and where it wants to come."
"2640.2"," Here you will be opening another one tag and here you will pass your ID."
"2644.2"," Okay, so this ID must be similar to this ID name."
"2648.2"," So I will give the same ID name over here and I just close my tag over here."
"2653.2"," Okay, so this is like whenever you're finding my hyperlink, whenever it is my hyperlink is selected."
"2659.2"," So just pass to my ID name so it will just maybe get to down."
"2664.2"," Okay, this is how we'll be using an external link."
"2667.2"," Sorry internal link."
"2668.2"," This is what we will be using an internal link, but external link is very simple."
"2672.2"," You just need to use a h reference and inside here, you will just pass your hyperlink."
"2677.2"," That is our external link and this is what we will be doing in our internal link."
"2681.2"," We will have one ID."
"2683.2"," So towards that ID when my hyperlink is clicked, I will just navigate my page."
"2688.2"," Okay, so yes, so is it clear ways internal and external links?"
"2695.2"," Okay, yeah."
"2700.2"," So this is how we will be using internal link."
"2703.2"," So now let us see how to have our image because then we will be seeing how to have our image tag."
"2712.2"," Okay, so I will also show you in the ppt."
"2717.2"," So as we saw, we will be having our HTML links."
"2720.2"," So we will be having ankle tag and what all the value which we are going to pass inside will be using a h reference."
"2727.2"," So h reference is nothing, but it is the attribute."
"2730.2"," It will just refer to the hyperlink."
"2732.2"," So h's are hyperlink and r is our reference."
"2736.2"," Okay, so that is what we will be calling h's are reference tag."
"2739.2"," Sorry hyperlink and all is a reference."
"2742.2"," So it would be hyperlink reference."
"2745.2"," So that is what we will be using a tag and it will refer to what hyperlink and will pass our URL and well close our anchor tag."
"2753.2"," So this is the external link link what we do what we did yesterday."
"2757.2"," We have user anchor tag and this would be our hyperlink reference will pass the Amazon ID."
"2762.2"," So whenever my Amazon ID like whenever my hyperlink here is click, I will just navigate to my page because my hyperlink is referring to this page."
"2771.2"," So this would be my hyperlink, but where it is referring it is referring to this page right whenever I'm clicking this it must take me to the another one page and that we call it as external reference."
"2785.2"," Okay, and yeah, so here it is what we saw."
"2789.2"," So this is this is all our external."
"2792.2"," So what are the value you want to pass you need to just copy your entire URL it can be anything."
"2797.2"," So if you're just passing that it will just take you to the another page."
"2801.2"," So external is it will not just come in your own web page it will be taking you to another pages."
"2807.2"," So it always it must not be only the external like you need not to give Amazon or flip card or Facebook.com Google.com."
"2816.2"," So consider in case if you're having one web page created, but another one like in case if you want to click this web page your next the page must be opening means also you can give your hyperlink file over there like if you're going to have your HTML."
"2831.2"," So let me show so I'm having already some HTML files over here."
"2836.2"," Okay, so if my hyperlink is going to click and I will pass my my web page if I want to open that what I will do will just pass it over here in the place of external hyperlink."
"2848.2"," So instead of this so let me copy or let me create another one hyperlink."
"2853.2"," Okay, so I will use a H reference where it is going to refer it is going to refer another but then it is a same HTML page."
"2861.2"," So I will just give my name okay and I will keep just give my extension okay and I will just you my page hyperlink."
"2874.2"," Okay, and I can close my anchor tag or it."
"2878.2"," So if I'm going to save this and if I'm going to run this."
"2884.2"," So let us go and let us click this it will take me to the another one page right so it is another one page but then it is just taking us to another one page the same we can also maybe get to our HTML file and also we can just maybe get to some other website also both is possible."
"2902.2"," So first what you need to do is you just need to pass inside your reference so the value you need to pass us you need to just use all you need to just give exactly in what you said like uppercase or lowercase like how you're having you just need to pass it and the extension so you just need to pass your extension in case of what is going to be our HTML file or you can just even will just pass your so if I'm going to pass this."
"2930.2"," Refresh this and I will just click this it will this then take to some other page over here so this is how I will be just navigating to other pages so which we call it as external because when I'm just clicking this it is not coming in my own page it is taking me to some other page right so this is external link and internal link even I'm clicking it will not take me to some other it will just navigate inside my own page okay these are the two types of link."
"2959.2"," So now let's see about HTML images okay so image for adding image also will be having an image tag so how will be adding us so let me have below this so whenever I'm going to add a new image I need to pass my image tag so this will be using IMG so that's the reason we call HTML as a human readable because what are the tag which we are going to pass like it is it would be easy to remember."
"2989.2"," Right and that's the reason we call it as human readable format now if I'm going to pass my image so I will just give my image tag and here I will pass one value called SRC so this SRC is again attribute like how we saw hedge reference is a attribute will be having SRC this is again going to be my attribute so what I will call it as means it is my source so it refers to my image source so what I will do I will just give equal symbol and within."
"3019.2"," In my double quotes I will just pass my image so this although you can either pass it in a format of a PNG or G bug okay so let me have image dot so I'm having one image in a format of GIF so I'll just pass it."
"3036.2"," Here you can see right so okay I'm just having image so you just need to give exactly in that name bundly so let me have it as image and that is in a format of GIF so guys you can use your PNG file also JPEG also you can go ahead and use your GIF files also okay and I will just say this so now if I'm just going to run my file."
"3066.2"," If I'm just refreshing so let's use this internal link it will just navigate down so now you can see the difference right and here the one thing is my images very big right so my image is very big I doesn't want this image to be this much big I just want finally within it must fit to that window in that case what we can do was along with this image tag we can pass the height and width of the image so height represents the height of the image."
"3095.2"," And with represents the width of the image so I'll just give my height must be off 450 okay and my width must be off so let's take it must be up 650 so if I'm going to pass this it will not be in a field so access it was an big size right if I'm going to refresh it will adjust to my size which I'm going to give okay so that's the reason along with image tag will pass the height and width."
"3124.2"," So in case if I'm going to increase my width my height reminds me same only my width size will increase okay if I'm just going to run this again here you can see right my height reminds me same but my width has been increased so like this so if you want your image to be in which format or which size can just pass this inside your height and width tag okay so I can just pass it inside your height and width that describes the height and width of your image."
"3154.2"," So basically if I'm going to keep any image it will take its own size so if it is going to be 1200 cross 1000 a hundred it will just take its own size because like it would be in pixel size right so if you want to change your size of your image you can along with this I am G and along with your source file you can just pass your height and width also so this would be our value so I am G is our image tag okay so we just need to close it."
"3184.2"," We just use this image tag we would need to close our image tag we just we are just going to pass this okay so we will be using our I am G which is our image and we will be using our src which would be the source of our image and we will pass which image to display we will give our image name and not only this name you can also pass the path okay so like you can just go to your browser or where your location is going to be you can copy your location."
"3214.2"," And you can even give your file you can just copy this and you just need to give your image name that is after slash you need to give image that is also fine so in case of what is not if it is not working for you can just give or you can just pass the path okay so before this I will just give this level this give my slash I will give my image name and followed by my extension name and I will just run this."
"3244.2"," Okay so in case if it is not working you will get your x mark over here so because it's not taking the path so let me just remove this but in case if it isn't some other folder not in the same HTML because my files everything it is in the same HTML folder so that's the reason I'm showing box so in case if you're just going to take apart from any of this folder to some other folder if you're going to have image and in case if you want to access that image at that and you need to pass your."
"3274.2"," Path that is your folder path okay and now you just need to pass and you just need to refresh will get your image okay so yesterday we saw about market of image right so that like this is how we will be adding image so once this image is added so let me reduce my size let it be of 700 okay I will just pass my market tab over so."
"3300.2"," Okay I'll just pass my market tab and I will just close my market."
"3308.2"," Okay so if you're just passing much to over the image if you're just going and if you're just going to refresh you will get your scroll of an image okay yes you know what is your query."
"3329.2"," I just case any other doubts you know is there any other query you want to ask."
"3343.2"," So guys I'll wait for you if there is any other query you can just ping in the chat."
"3347.2"," Okay so can we resize the image as device screen size yeah it is possible but then like all the time it is not possible because background image we can set like that but this image we need to specify while I'm heightened with or else we will be having a divide tag like we need to use inside the like we'll be setting some frame and inside that will be using our divide tag and inside that will be passing our image if it is not going to be a valid."
"3377.2"," Ground image if it is going to be the external image which which you want to pass to your web page means you will be having frames that is you will be setting the height and weather of your image so considered in Amazon result right because here it is some advanced to concept okay so here what they will do they will set a frame okay so this would be one of the frame and this would be one of the frame and this is the text and here this would be the frame so inside that frame they are just specifying what they are just placing there."
"3407.2"," So if I'm going to have my divide tag so this is like they will be using some divide tags in order to divide the entire screen so it would be like they will be using a divide tags and they will just split the screen and they will just have the image over here this is would be some advanced will be using frames and inside that frame will be passing our divide tag first will divide the like size and with the website so once that website size has been split."
"3434.2"," So inside that first divide tag will pass the image okay like that we need to here you can see right it is split it equally into four parts which represents they are using some divide tags okay."
"3447.2"," Okay how the same website screen and laptop and mobile resizing yeah so that is like a four mobile interface there will be some other because if when it comes to application that will be two types of application one would be the web application and another one would be the mobile application so if I'm going to design for my website I will just consider this screen resolution of either my laptop or my PC right so in case if I'm going to design for my"
"3476.2"," mobile I will have some other interface in order to design that so we will be having our Android so in that Android I will just use my frames or like I will just have my navigation over there and I will create their over because for mobile application will separate like design separately and for web application will be designing separately and that's the reason whenever we are opening it is just fitting so this is all about website and the will be using our HTML JavaScript or just getting the same size as I am using it."
"3506.2"," So in case of what is going to be mobile we will be using some other set of applications okay any other doubts please."
"3516.2"," Okay yes mono is it here."
"3529.2"," Yeah so yes finally let's see what are the list so list is nothing but so in case if I want to list my values like if I want to add any bulletings I can go ahead and use my list it and so in list we will be having two types so one would be the ordered list and another one would be like"
"3558.2"," an ordered list right so I will be having list will be having so if when it comes to listed tag so what are the value I need to pass I will pass inside my ELI so I like the presence list I will just close my list also right so basically we will be having two types of list one would be like ordered list okay so I will be having numberings over here like one to three like that I will be having numberings so this we call it as ordered list so how would be the syntax means I will be using the list."
"3588.2"," I will be having ordered list tag so inside that I will pass how many list values I need to pass so if it is like apple orange I will have my list okay I will pass my I will pass my first list okay I will just end my first list I'll just open my another list so it will have a it will show in a format of yeah no issues no issues okay I will have like this apple orange like that okay so it would be in a format of number one and number two."
"3618.2"," So this we call it as ordered list I will close my order list also right so this will be enough amount of numbering one and so this we call it as ordered list and when it comes to unordered list so it is similar to our bulletings okay so if it is like unordered list how I will be having this in taxes I will be having you will and make sure what are the value we are going to pass we need to use that list it okay so then only it will be considered as first and second okay I will just have the list."
"3648.2"," So what I will do it will create one bulletings over here okay I will just close my list it and if I'm going to pass another one again I will pass my list it and again I will just give the second fruit name okay this would be like again bulletings okay the differences like if I'm going to use ordered list it would be in a format of one to three four and if I'm going to use unordered list it would be in a format of bulletings but what are the value you are going to pass it again."
"3676.2"," So that is the list it is okay so I will show you how to add this in our HTML."
"3686.2"," Okay so now if I'm going back to my HTML means so let us add okay I will just remove some of these and I will just add my listings in the top of the list."
"3704.2"," I will just add my listings in the top of my page okay so I will just create one break tab over here after this I will just create or just give it over here we will just create but let's first create with ordered list okay we just specific ordered list and inside this order list I will create my list value okay so let's take a paragraph or let's take what are the values or what are we did so let's take"
"3733.2"," paragraph and what we did is we have added some links over there so we need to close it so after this we have just added our link so let's take we have added our internal link so I will pass this internal link and we have also added our external link so I will pass another one list it must be of my external link."
"3762.2"," And I will pass my another one value okay so that is going to be my image right so I have added my image also so we did so let's close this and finally I will close my order list so these are the values which I'm going to represent in a format of one to three for five now when I'm just going to save and run in my browser."
"3790.2"," Here you can see right because these are the format these are in the format of list so I'm getting one to three for five because it represents ordered list right so it is just listing so here also you can just specify your font style and you can give it in a center so certain means you will be using your center tab so every properties you can add but then you just need to add it over here like before you are starting so if it is going to be so you just need to give your font."
"3820.2"," Okay if you want to give different font you just need to go and give you over here font face so let me have."
"3830.2"," Okay I will just take any one of my font I will just pass my font and I can also end my font style so this font will be only available for my list the tag and also in this place if I'm going to pass you will tag it will be in a format of bulletings I will not get my numbers over here but then."
"3860.2"," I will get my bulletings okay you see the difference so I guess the font has more been added so let me check it once."
"3891.2"," Okay and also if you want to make this as a heading you can also again pass but in case if you're going to pass your heading we cannot give our font so either you need to pass your headings or you need to give your font and bold properties so as of now let me give in in a format of H3 tag that will close my H3 tag."
"3912.2"," Okay so as I said tag this not a case sensitive so you can either go ahead and give it like a capital or small letter it will be reflecting in our link okay sorry in our list so this is what we saw like two types of link one would be like ordered and another one would be of unordered list so if it is ordered it will be in a format of 123 or if it is in unordered but will be getting a bulletings over here."
"3940.2"," So yes this is it any other doubts regarding this like what we saw link heading tag paragraph tag or image any other doubts."
"3957.2"," Yes yeah that's it from I said guys if there is any doubt you can just reach out to us okay so I'll in this meet so if there is any queries if you can ping or not you can just in this meet."
"3970.2"," Yes I hope there is no queries with me in this thank you so much guys have a good."
