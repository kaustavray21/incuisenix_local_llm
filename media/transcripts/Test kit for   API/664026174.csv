"645.0"," So, if it is not uploaded, it will be uploaded too."
"660.0"," you"
"690.0"," you"
"720.0"," Okay, so I hope let's start now. Let me share my screen and if it is visible, you can just"
"737.0"," ping in the chat. Yes, you guys can you see my screen? So, yesterday we have covered"
"746.0"," until our HTML tax and attributes, right? So, now we can just start with our HTML"
"752.0"," headings. Okay, so once we are covering the image topics, I will also show you how to add"
"758.0"," more Q over the image data as well. Okay, so yes, so let's start now. So, we will be seeing our HTML"
"769.0"," headings. So, heading is nothing but so whenever I'm going to display because rather than"
"774.0"," text or rather than a passage, we need to have some boldings in our heading, right? So, that"
"780.0"," we will be calling as a heading tag. So, in HTML, we will be having nearly a six heading"
"786.0"," tags. Okay, so our HTML tag will start from H1. So, which is very, very bold and it will"
"798.0"," be until H6. So, until this, we can choose what would be our heading. So, if you want to make"
"804.0"," it as a main heading, you can go for heading one. So, if it is like if you want to go for a"
"809.0"," sub heading or if you want to have another one heading below that, you can just go with H2H3"
"814.0"," tag as well, right? So, most probably in our HTML will be based like using our heading tag."
"821.0"," So, what is the use of heading tag means by default, it will be bolder and it will be in big"
"827.0"," size. We doesn't need to give any font size that is we know need to give what would be the font"
"833.0"," size or whether it must be bold or italic, like that we doesn't need to give any property"
"838.0"," for this heading tag, which is need to use H1 or H2. Okay, so that's the reason in HTML,"
"845.0"," we use H tag to tell the web browser that the text that is inside the tag is to be displayed"
"851.0"," as a heading or not because basically we will be having list of quotes, right? So, in case"
"856.0"," if you can even just check to the Wikipedia. So, if we are having means only heading tag,"
"861.0"," it will be bolded, right? Other paragraph, it will not be bolded. So, in order to work"
"866.0"," on, we will be having two different tags, one is our heading tag, which we will be using"
"871.0"," only for headings or subheadings and the another one would be over paragraph tag, which we will"
"876.0"," be given. So, that is for our paragraph or passage. Okay. So, here as I said our HTML tag,"
"885.0"," we will be having six tags. So, H1 is the most big that is it will be in bigger size and"
"892.0"," H6, it will be in the smaller size. So, it is in the decreasing order. It will be very"
"897.0"," bolded and it will be very big and it keeps on decreasing its size. So, that's the reason"
"902.0"," it is referred we will be having six heading tags in our HTML. Okay. So, yeah. So, as I"
"910.0"," say, H1, it is for the title of the blog or if you are going to display any blog or article."
"916.0"," So, what is going to be the main heading, you will be using your H1 tag because it will"
"922.0"," be very bolded and if it is like subheading, you can choose any one of your heading tag."
"927.0"," And so, as it said, H6, it is going to be least and we can use it for our node or any"
"934.0"," reader format also we can use our H6 tag."
"947.0"," Okay. So, and another one more important thing is whenever we are going to use the HTML"
"953.0"," tags. So, we can like we will be having our bold tag also I will show you what is bold tag"
"959.0"," or what is italic tag. So, we need not to use always this bold and italic tag. So, if it"
"965.0"," is going to be your heading. So, what you will be using is only you will be using your heading"
"970.0"," tag. You will not use big bold or italic or any other like that you will not use. So, here"
"975.0"," is what it is mentioned whenever you are going to use any heading you will be using only your"
"980.0"," heading tag or not the bold tag. Okay. So, now let's see some of the example for heading"
"986.0"," and sorry, I will just show you what is the bold italic tag as well as I will show you the"
"993.0"," heading tags. Okay. So, let us have here any one of the heading. So, as I said what are the"
"1000.0"," values which we will be having it must be only inside our body tag. Right. So, yesterday"
"1005.0"," we saw until this we have just we are just running our sample webpage and we just added one"
"1012.0"," text and one hyperlink and we are just crawling this text. Right. So, this is what we saw"
"1017.0"," yesterday. So, now instead of this. So, let me have general mark you and here here we can"
"1026.0"," see it would be in smaller size which is the default size. Right. So, here welcome to my"
"1031.0"," page it is in default size. So, now I am going to use heading tag over here. Okay. So, I can"
"1037.0"," specify what type of heading or how much bigger small I want. So, here what I am going to use"
"1043.0"," is I am going to use my h1 tag. So, as I said h1 is going to be very very big and you can use"
"1050.0"," it till h6 tag. It starts from h1 and ends till h6. So, let us have h1 tag over here. So, as"
"1057.0"," I said what are the tags you are opening you must close that tag. Okay. So, as we are using"
"1064.0"," inside the mark you. So, I am just I just want welcome to my the page allownin very bolder"
"1070.0"," format. So, only for this I am passing my h1 tag and I am closing my h1 tag. Okay. So, now"
"1077.0"," let us say this and go back and run this. Here you can see right it is bolder my heading format."
"1084.0"," It is in big size. Now, it is not in my default web page text. It is not big size. Right. So, this"
"1092.0"," is what we will be doing in our heading tag. So, this is our h1 and also I will show you"
"1099.0"," the h6. So, let us have this hyperlink that is Amazon hyperlink as a h5 tag. So, we will"
"1106.0"," get some difference. So, I am just going to use h5 so that it would be in small format."
"1113.0"," Okay. So, let us run this. Okay. Can you see it is in our heading. Here you can see it"
"1122.0"," is automatically bolder or to make it more clear let us have h3 tag because it would be"
"1127.0"," somewhat big in size. Let us have h3 tag. And if I am going to refresh this here can you"
"1135.0"," see the difference basically heading tag will have bold function in build to it. We need"
"1141.0"," not to give any bold over there. It will be automatically heading tag will be bolder."
"1146.0"," Okay. So, we will be having six heading tags. It starts from h1 and ends till h6. So, h6"
"1153.0"," it would be very, very least at h1 at will be bigger in size. So, is there any doubts regarding"
"1159.0"," the heading tag wise if there is any doubt please bring in the chat. All right. Yes."
"1171.0"," She knew. Okay. So, now let us go with the. Yeah. So, I will just say it right. I will show"
"1186.0"," you what is bold and what is italic also. So, apart from this we will be having some other"
"1192.0"," tag also. So, that we will be calling it as. So, we will be having our bold tag. So, we"
"1199.0"," will be using b with this for our bold. Okay. So, whenever I am going to give any text inside"
"1206.0"," my b tag it will be in bolder format. Okay. This is what we call it as bold. So, this if you"
"1213.0"," want to give any bolding format because in our web page you might be seeing right. So, if"
"1218.0"," it is like any particular single word it must be highlighted we can use a bold tag. Okay."
"1224.0"," And if you want that to be italic you can use I so I is nothing but it is a italic. Okay."
"1231.0"," So, my text will appear as italic. So, if you want both bold and italic means at that time"
"1237.0"," you can open your bold tag and also you can open your italic tag you can pass your text."
"1243.0"," Okay. Bold italic and you can close both of your tag. Okay. So, bold it. So, if it is I like"
"1253.0"," you can close any tag at first but the thing is you should make sure you are closing your"
"1258.0"," tag. Okay. So, this is what we will be calling it as bold italic and apart from this we will"
"1264.0"," be also having underlying tag. Okay. So, if I am going to use you so whatever value I am"
"1271.0"," going to pass inside it will be underlined. Okay. So, and I will be using my slash tag also."
"1279.0"," So, these are the other tags apart from heading we will be having. So, we can use these tags"
"1284.0"," also if your text wants to be bold and italic you can use bold and italic and if it wants to be"
"1290.0"," underlined we can also use underlined tags. I will also show you some examples."
"1298.0"," So, let's have in our webpage itself."
"1303.0"," So, here let's add some body. So, inside this body let's take some other values and I"
"1310.0"," don't want this to be in center. So, what I will give. So, let me give."
"1316.0"," Hi. This is my HTML session. So, if it is going to be high use my HTML session and I want"
"1328.0"," to be bolded format I can use beta. Okay. I will just beta go over here and only my HTML"
"1336.0"," must be bolded. So, I will end over here. Okay. Slash. So, this means only this particular"
"1343.0"," HTML it will be bolded. So, others it will be in normal text. So, let's run this."
"1352.0"," Can you see now we are having a text over here and hi this is my HTML session."
"1357.0"," Only HTML is bolded. Right. Same in case if you want to underline this same what we need"
"1364.0"," to do is we will be using our underline tag or we will be using our italic tag."
"1369.0"," So, let's have that. So, let us have both or the entire text must be in italic format."
"1376.0"," Okay. So, I will just pass within entire message. Okay. So, now everything it will be italic"
"1383.0"," and HTML it will be in bold italic and if you want to underline this session we can use"
"1389.0"," underline tag over here. We can use you tag and we just need to end over you tag."
"1395.0"," Okay. So, now it means so we will be having like entire text as italic format and HTML is with bold"
"1403.0"," and italic because we are passing italic to entire. So, it will be like considered as bold"
"1408.0"," and italic and we will be having our session. So, it will be italic and also this text will"
"1414.0"," be underlined. So, now let's run this. So, if I'm going to refresh here you can see."
"1421.0"," Right. So, my entire text will be in italic format and this I'm just passing bold over here."
"1427.0"," So, it will have both the property bold as well as italic and here my session will be in"
"1433.0"," underline format. So, this is how we will be using the other text which is bold and we will"
"1439.0"," be having italic tag and also we will be having our underline tag. Okay."
"1444.0"," So, guys is this clear or do you want me to explain another one more time?"
"1448.0"," Okay. So, yeah. Hope it's clear. So, yeah. Now, let me show you. So, after this."
"1462.0"," So, here you can see, right. So, it is like taking the default font size."
"1467.0"," So, it might be caliby or it might be anything. So, it is taking the default size. Right."
"1472.0"," So, consider it if we want to set our own font size. How can we do that? So, it is like still"
"1479.0"," it is possible to pass our own text format. So, for that we will be using another one tag which"
"1485.0"," will be naming that as a font. So, let it be. So, I'll just make a copy of this."
"1491.0"," So, and another one more thing if you just keep on going to pass this it will be like I'll"
"1498.0"," pass this it will not be in a next line. It will consider it in a single line. Okay."
"1503.0"," So, if you are just passing without anything, it will be in a same line. Can you see?"
"1507.0"," But it must not be in a same line. I just want this to print in my next line. Right."
"1512.0"," So, because it is not taking a next it is just passing in a single text itself."
"1517.0"," For this we will be using another one tag which is we call it as break tag. Okay."
"1522.0"," So, that what it will be like as the name itself it indicates will be using as BR."
"1529.0"," Okay. So, I will be using BR tag. So, this tag we need not to close this because without"
"1536.0"," closing also it will work. So, it is nothing but break tag. So, only tag which will which"
"1542.0"," we will not close is break tag. But if we are closing this also no, no issues. Okay."
"1547.0"," So, this break tag will leave one break which is like one enter. Okay."
"1552.0"," So, this break tag will leave one space in our format. Okay."
"1557.0"," So, now let's consider I just want this to be in a separate separate line. Okay."
"1562.0"," I just don't want to be in a single line. So, what I will do I will just pass a break tag over here."
"1568.0"," So, after the sentence is going to complete it will just hit one enter space over here."
"1574.0"," And in a next line I will get another one. So, let's do need to add all the tags over here."
"1580.0"," So, let it be a simple text. Okay. So, I am just going to pass this."
"1598.0"," Okay. So, just give me a moment."
"1603.0"," Okay. So, now if I am going to refresh can you see the difference it is in next line."
"1608.0"," So, if you want to give another one enter you can just pass another one break."
"1612.0"," So, that it will be like it will give to enter of space and will get it over here."
"1617.0"," So, if I want another one space again just give another one break condition or break tag over here."
"1623.0"," I will save this and then we will go back and if I am going to run it will leave another one space."
"1629.0"," So, this is how we will be giving space or enter in our tags in the format of tag we will be using our break tag which will break the sentence."
"1638.0"," Like it will just give one end like it is similar to one enter how we will be pressing in our keyboard it will just give an enter and it will be displaying in a next line."
"1647.0"," It just breaks the sentence to be like if we are going to have one length sentence we can just break that sentence into two to three parts."
"1656.0"," So, that is what we will be using break tag."
"1659.0"," Now, if I want to change my font style over here."
"1663.0"," So, how I can do that means what I will do will be having another one option called font."
"1669.0"," Okay. So, we will be having font tag."
"1674.0"," So, I will open my font tag."
"1676.0"," So, what are these styles you want to give you can go and give it inside this font tag."
"1682.0"," I will just specify my font face."
"1685.0"," Okay. So, here you need to specify equal to and I would suggest always just copy paste your font style."
"1692.0"," Okay. So, if I want to paste or if I want to go and use different font, you just go to my font and I will just copy my font style."
"1703.0"," Okay. So, let's have this."
"1706.0"," Okay. I will just copy my font and I will just paste it over here."
"1711.0"," I will close. I will close my font style. Sorry font tag."
"1715.0"," So, font and you need to give your face."
"1718.0"," Okay. Font face describes which is the style of font which you are going to give."
"1723.0"," So, once after this you need to close your font."
"1726.0"," So, until before you are closing if it is like three lines, five lines."
"1730.0"," So, until this file ends you will get this font face."
"1733.0"," Or what is the font you are going to specify it will be there."
"1737.0"," Now, let's run this."
"1739.0"," So, if I'm going to refresh this, only this text will be in my different because I'm using a font property that is I'm using a font face that is font tag."
"1750.0"," So, inside that font tag, I'm just passing like what is the style of my font I want."
"1756.0"," Right. You can just pass any font but make sure you're copy wasting because in case if you are typing,"
"1761.0"," if the character is mismatching, we will not get the exact font."
"1764.0"," So, make sure you're just either copy wasting from your world or you're just copy wasting from your mode pack."
"1770.0"," You will get your font over here."
"1772.0"," Okay. So, this is how we will be creating different styles of font or we'll be using bold italic underline also."
"1779.0"," So, here also you can just pass or you can make it bolder italic."
"1783.0"," But the thing is whenever you are going to open any tag, you need to close your tag."
"1788.0"," That's the main thing. Okay. So, yes, guys, any doubts? I'm telling this."
"1810.0"," Okay. All right. Let's go with the ppt."
"1813.0"," So, now we have done with our like headings and we also saw some other new fonts with result by bold italic underline and how to set the font."
"1823.0"," So, now let's see how we will be using a paragraph tag."
"1826.0"," So, as I said, what would be different between paragraph tag and what would be like we will be having two types."
"1832.0"," One would be my paragraph. Okay. I will be having paragraph tag."
"1840.0"," And I will be having a pre tag. Okay. So, this paragraph, if I'm going to specify it will be mentioned as p tag."
"1849.0"," Okay. So, if I'm going to specify pre, it will be considered as p tag."
"1854.0"," Okay. What would be the difference means? So, consider if I'm going to give a text or if I'm going to copy paste and by default or mistakenly, if I'm giving empty spaces over your means."
"1865.0"," So, if I'm going to pass this inside my p tag, what my browser will do means my browser will like ignore all the empty spaces, right."
"1874.0"," So, in the place of one space, if I mistakenly give two to three spaces means it will be automatically corrected and it will consider that one space."
"1883.0"," So, that is the importance of paragraph. So, the browser will correct, but in the case of pre tag."
"1889.0"," So, even if I'm going to leave two to three spaces, it will print as such. Okay. So, why this pre tag or when this pre tag will be used means so considered if I'm going to create any forms or any application forms which will available in our website."
"1906.0"," So, in that website, I will be having certain spaces, right. So, if I want to have any buttons or after that button, if I want to give to two to three spaces means at that time, we can use this pre tag."
"1917.0"," The tag mainly will use enough forms. Okay. So, it will just specify where the text box must be there or where the label must be there because it will not change."
"1927.0"," So, whenever or what are the things which we are going to pass inside the pre tag, it will remind us such so that is the use of pre tag and this could be the difference between paragraph and beta."
"1938.0"," So, here it will be ignoring the extra spaces here it will not ignore people just printed as such. Okay."
"1947.0"," So, now, so let's see the difference. So, as I said, HTMLP is used to display block of text and that starts on the new line. So, here whenever you are just going to copy paste. So, what are the value you are just copy pasting it will be considered as a paragraph."
"1966.0"," It will not just split in between, but then if you want to use any like break statement inside that inside beta, you can still use your break down. Okay."
"1976.0"," So, here here there is an example. So, if you are going to give inside this paragraph time, you will get a expected result as this like it will just ignore and it will just print as such."
"1987.0"," And when it comes to as I said paragraph will be passing inside our beta. So, one like you can just start your beta and you can give a lines of text which you want to give it can be 10 lines from 10 lines 50 lines and when it when you are going to end your paragraph, you need to close your beta."
"2007.0"," So, this is what will be do is beta and as I said, there is a difference between P and paragraph sorry beta and three. So, what this pre-tap do is like in case if my text is going to be in this format that is without any space."
"2021.0"," So, if I'm using beta, it will just ignore all my empty spaces and I will get only this result, but in case if I'm going to use pre-tap. So, whatever value I'm going to give as such, it will print in my pre-tap. So, that would be the difference between beta and pre-tap."
"2038.0"," Okay."
"2041.0"," So, let's see some examples for this."
"2046.0"," So, let me copy from any website or even from Intel, but I'll just open."
"2058.0"," Okay. So, I'm just going to copy any one of the passage."
"2061.0"," Okay. So, let me copy this. So, this is in a format of paragraph, right. So, I can just copy any paragraph. If it is going to be a big, also I can just copy that and I'll just paste it in my page."
"2082.0"," Even for paragraph, you can use this font. Okay. So, if I want my paragraph to be in this font, I can just put it over here. I will open my p tag which is my paragraph tag and I will paste my entire text. So, once this text has been entered, I will close my paragraph tag."
"2104.0"," Okay. So, here you can see or let me have some spaces over here. Okay. So, I will just add some extra spaces over here. So, let's see whether this space is reflecting in my paragraph or not."
"2116.0"," If I'm going to copy this and if I'm going to run over here."
"2120.0"," Okay. So, let us refresh this page. Here you can see right. So, I have just left some spaces over here near machine learning and artificial intelligence, but as it is a paragraph tag, it is ignoring the empty spaces and it is just displaying in a format of paragraph."
"2142.0"," So, it is just ignoring. So, in this case, if I'm going to use pre tag over here, it will not ignore these spaces. It will just give as such. So, here if it is space means I will get a space in my browser as well."
"2157.0"," If I'm going to refresh this, can you see the difference over here because pre tag will never skip this empty spaces. It will just print as such, but paragraph tag will just understand this and it will give or it will just remove all those spaces."
"2173.0"," So, that would be the difference between our pre tag and paragraph tag. Okay. So, yes, there is any other doubts regarding p tag or paragraph tag. If you are having any doubts, please feel free to ask your doubt or share your queries."
"2204.0"," Yes, there is any doubts. Mono and Shino."
"2210.0"," Okay, it's clear. Right. So, if you're having any doubts, just stop me and you can just ask your queries. No, he's just."
"2219.0"," Okay. So, now let's see with the link. Okay. So, we will be having two types of link as I saw. Like yesterday, we saw one external link. Right. So, we will be having two types of link in our HTML."
"2230.0"," So, one would be our internal link. Okay, which is like inside our paragraph. One would be our internal links and another one would be our external links."
"2241.0"," Okay. So, external yesterday, we are like we have did some navigation to Amazon right that we call it as external link. It will not be navigated within its page. It will just navigate to the next page. So, that we call it as external link from one page to the another page."
"2260.0"," So, that we call it as external link. So, when it comes to internal link, it will just navigate within my page, navigate inside its own page."
"2273.0"," Okay. So, it will just navigate inside its own page. Whereas external link, it will not navigate inside its own page. It will just go to the next page."
"2284.0"," This is what we will be having. Or we saw yesterday. So, yesterday what was all external link that is we just passed when inside our h reference and we just from our webpage."
"2294.0"," We just navigated to the another one, which is our Amazon. Now, we'll just see what would be the instant like internal link. Okay. So, why internal link is used means to consider if you're just having a number of or thousand lines of text."
"2310.0"," And it will be just crawling down and you will be seeing or reading the article. But suddenly if you want to go and see the top article, we cannot just go back. Right."
"2319.0"," So, again, you need to scroll back. So, what this internal link will do. So, if I want to go to the top, if I'm pressing this link automatically, it will navigate to the top of the page."
"2330.0"," So, same if I want to go to the end, it will just from my from my link if I'm clicking it will just navigate to the bottom of the page. So, that is the use of navigation. Okay."
"2341.0"," So, I'll just show you and let's see the PPT. Okay. So, first let me show you."
"2350.0"," So, let us just copy this text so that it would be easy for us to just check with the internal and external. I'll just copy this."
"2365.0"," Okay. Entire. I'm just copying, but I'm not going to paste it inside my font. So, I'm just going to paste it down."
"2373.0"," Okay. So, this would be like I will be having more text."
"2378.0"," So, it looks like my it will be enough for my out of the page. Right. So, considered if I'm going to have more than this or if I'm going to have a number of values or number of lines over here."
"2389.0"," So, when I'm viewing here, suddenly if I want to go to down. So, at that time, we need a link to navigate right inside our page."
"2398.0"," So, that would be the use of internal link. Okay. So, let me take this as well."
"2411.0"," Okay. I'll just pass this two times so that it would be still while we're having text over here."
"2420.0"," Okay. If I'm going to refresh. So, here you can see I'm getting a scroll. So, it is like not only one scroll. So, in case if I'm going to have thousands or like number of lines, I will be keep on scrolling."
"2438.0"," So, at that time, so manually, we need to scroll down or scroll up. So, if I'm going to pass my link over here. So, whenever I'm going to press my link, it will automatically maybe get me to down or it will automatically take me to down."
"2451.0"," So, that's the reason we will be using our internal link. So, same. So, for using our internal link, we'll be using our attack, which is our anchor tag, one."
"2460.0"," So, inside our anchor tag will be passing our values over there. So, consider. So, in my body, I will just give it over here. Okay."
"2469.0"," After my module, I just need to have my link over here. So, what I will do, I will just pass my anchor tag. I will just pass my a hits reference. So, here, we need to pass a hash value over here. So, this would be your ID. Okay. So, this would be a ID. We just need to give any name for our internal link."
"2490.0"," So, let me take us internal. Okay. So, it will just check for its ID and I will pass my link over here. My internal link. Okay. So, this would be my link hyperlink. So, what is the hyperlink that I'm going to give us my internal link. So, this would be like underline and it will be in a format of hyperlink. So, now I will close my anchor tag. Right."
"2515.0"," So, once after my closing my anchor tag, so I have specified my link. Right. But it needs to refer to some other point. So, what I will do. So, where it needs to take me, it needs to take me to here. Right."
"2529.0"," So, again, I will pass. So, anchor. I will just pass my ID. Okay. So, what is my ID? My ID is internal. Okay. And I will close my tag. So, what it will do. So, if it is going to be internal, when I'm going to click that link, it needs to take to me in this place. So, that's the reason I'm passing ID over here. I'll just save this and I need to run over here. Okay."
"2557.0"," So, here you can see right I'm having a link over here. So, it is in a hyperlink format. So, when I'm going to click this link, it needs to take me down. Right. It is taking me down. Right. So, if I'm going to click this, it will automatically take me down. So, the thing to notice is external link is very easy, but internal link it will be somewhat confusing. But your format would be like I will just show you. So, whenever you're going to pass your internal link."
"2585.0"," So, the place where you're going to give your link, you need to pass your anchor tag and you need to pass your reference link over here. So, here the whatever value you're going to hit you, it must be followed by here has. Okay. So, it can be any name. What are the value you're going to give. So, make sure it must be similar to your ID name. Okay. So, this is basically the ID. Okay. I'll pass my ID name."
"2611.0"," And after that, I will just give what is my hyperlink. So, here is where we will get the hyperlink text. Okay. So, once this hyperlink text is done, I just need to close my anchor tag. I will close my anchor tag. Right. So, now it will become a hyperlink. So, when I'm clicking this, it needs to take me to somewhere. Right. So, it needs to take me somewhere."
"2634.0"," So, where you want this page to go, you just need to go down and where it wants to come. Here you will be opening another one tag and here you will pass your ID. Okay. So, this ID must be similar to this ID name. So, I will give the same ID name over here. And I just close my tag over here. Okay."
"2654.0"," Okay. So, this is like whenever you're finding my hyperlink whenever it is my hyperlink is selected. So, just pass to my ID name. So, it will just maybe get to down. Okay. This is how we'll be using an external link. Sorry internal link. This is what we'll be using an internal link, but external link is very simple."
"2673.0"," You just need to use a hits reference and inside here, you will just pass your hyperlink that is our external link. And this is what we will be doing in our internal link. We will have one ID. So towards that ID when my hyperlink is clicked, I will just maybe get my page. Okay. So, yes, there's a clear ways internal and external links."
"2694.5"," Okay."
"2699.5"," Yeah."
"2700.5"," So, this is how we will be using internal link. So, now let us see how to have our image because then we will be seeing how to have our image tag."
"2712.5"," Okay. So, I will also show in the ppt."
"2717.5"," So, as we saw, we will be having our HTML links. So, we'll be having an uncle tag and what all the value which we are going to pass inside will be using a h reference. So, h reference is nothing, but it is the attribute."
"2730.5"," It will just refer to the hyperlink. So, h is our hyperlink and r is our reference. Okay. So, that is what we will be calling h is our reference tag. Sorry hyperlink and all is a reference."
"2742.5"," So, it would be hyperlink reference. So, that is what we will be using a tag and it will refer to what hyperlink and will pass our URL and will close our anchor tag."
"2753.5"," So, this is the external link. Like what we do what we did yesterday. We have user anchor tag and this would be our hyperlink reference will pass the Amazon ID."
"2762.5"," So, whenever my Amazon ID like whenever my hyperlink here is click, I will just navigate to my page because my hyperlink is referring to this page. Right. So, this would be my hyperlink, but where it is referring it is referring to this page. Right. Whenever I'm clicking this, it must take me to the one other one page and that we call it as external reference."
"2786.5"," Okay. And yeah, so here it is what we saw. So, this is this is all our external. So, what are the value you want to pass. You need to just copy your entire URL. It can be anything."
"2797.5"," So, if you are just passing that it will just take you to the another page. So, external is it will not just come in your own web page. It will be taking you to another pages."
"2807.5"," So, it always it must not be only the external like you need not to give Amazon or flip or Facebook.com Google.com. So, consider in case if you're having one web page created, but another one like in case if you want to click this web page, your next the page must be opening means also you can give your hyperlink file over there."
"2828.5"," Like if you're going to have your HTML. So, let me show. So, I'm having already some HTML files over here. Okay. So, if my hyperlink is going to click and I will pass my my web page. If I want to open that what I will do will just pass it over here in the place of external hyperlink."
"2847.5"," So, instead of this. So, let me copy or let me create another one hyperlink. Okay. So, I will use a h reference where it is going to refer it is going to refer another, but then it is a same HTML page. So, I will just give my name."
"2863.5"," Okay, and I will keep just give my extension."
"2867.5"," Okay, and I will just give my page hyperlink."
"2874.5"," Okay, and I can close my anchor tag or e tag. So, if I'm going to save this and if I'm going to run this."
"2883.5"," Let us go and let us click this. It will take me to the another one page. Right. So, it is another one page, but then it is just taking us to another one page."
"2893.5"," So, we can also maybe get to our HTML file and also we can just maybe get to some other website also both is possible."
"2902.5"," Just what you need to do was you just need to pass inside your reference. So, the value you need to pass is you need to just use or you need to just give exactly in what you said like uppercase or lowercase like how you are having you just need to pass it and the extension."
"2918.5"," In case of what is going to be a HTML file or you can just even will just pass your so if I'm going to pass this."
"2928.5"," I'll just refresh this and I will just click this will this then take to some other page over here."
"2936.5"," So, this is how we'll be just maybe getting to other pages. So, which we call it as external because when I'm just clicking this, it is not coming in my one page."
"2945.5"," It is taking me to some other page. Right. So, this is external link and internal link even I'm clicking it will not take me to some other it will just maybe get inside my own page."
"2957.5"," Okay. These are the two types of link."
"2961.5"," Okay. So, now let's see about HTML images. Okay. So, image for adding image also will be having an image tag. So, how will we adding us."
"2971.5"," So, let me have below this. So, whenever I'm going to add a new image, I need to pass my image tag. So, this will be using IMG."
"2981.5"," So, that's the reason we call HTML as a human readable because what are the tag which we are going to pass like it is it would be easy to remember right and that's the reason we call it as human readable format."
"2992.5"," Now, if I'm going to pass my image. So, I will just give my image tag and here I will pass one value called SRC. So, this SRC is again a attribute like how we saw H reference is a attribute will be having SRC."
"3006.5"," This is again going to be my attribute. So, what I will call it as means it is my source. So, it refers to my image source. So, what I will do I will just give equal symbol and within my double codes, I will just pass my image."
"3021.5"," So, this also you can either pass it in a format of a PNG or G bug. Okay. So, let me have image dot. So, I'm having one image in a format of GIF. So, I'll just pass it."
"3034.5"," Here you can see right. So, okay, I'm just having image. So, you just need to give exactly in that name, one."
"3042.5"," So, let me have it as image and that is in a format of GIF. So, guys, you can use your PNG file also JPEG also."
"3056.5"," And you can go ahead and use your zip files also. Okay. And I will just say this. So, now if I'm just going to run my file, if I'm just refreshing."
"3067.5"," So, let's use this internal link. It will just navigate down. So, now you can see the difference right. And here the one thing is my images very big. Right. So, my image is very big. I doesn't want this image to be this much big."
"3081.5"," I just want finally within it must fit to that window. In that case, what we can do is along with this image that we can pass the height and the ability image."
"3092.5"," So, height represents the height of the image and width represents the width of the image. So, I'll just give my height must be off 450. Okay. And my width must be off."
"3105.5"," So, let's take it must be of 650. So, if I'm going to pass this, it will not be in a field. So, access it was in big size. Right. If I'm going to refresh it will adjust to my size, which I'm going to give."
"3119.5"," Okay. So, that's the reason along with image tag will pass the height and width. So, in case if I'm going to increase my width, my height reminds me same."
"3129.5"," Only my width size will increase. Okay. If I'm just going to run this again, here you can see right my height reminds me same, but my width has been increased. So, like this. So, if you want your image to be in which format or width size can just pass this inside your height and width tag."
"3148.5"," Okay. So, you can just pass it inside your height and width that describes the height and width of your image. So, basically if I'm going to keep any image, it will take its own size."
"3158.5"," So, if it is going to be 1200 cross 1000 100, it will just take its own size because like it would be in pixel size, right. So, if you want to change your size of your image, you can along with this I am G and along with your source file."
"3173.5"," You can just pass your height and width also. So, this would be our value. So, I am G is our image tag. Okay. So, we just need to close this image tag."
"3185.5"," We need to close our image tag, we just we are just going to pass this. Okay. So, we will be using our I am G, which is our image and we will be using our src, which would be the source of our image and we will pass which image to display."
"3201.5"," We will give our image name and not only this name, you can also pass the path. Okay. So, like you can just go to your browser or where your location is going to be."
"3212.5"," You can copy your location and you can even give your file. Okay. You can just copy this and you just need to give your image name that is after slash need to give image dot J back that is also fine."
"3224.5"," So, in case of it is not if it is not working for you, you can just give or you can just pass your path. Okay. So, before this I will just give this level this give my slash I will give my image name and followed by my extension name and I will just run this."
"3244.5"," Okay. So, in case if it is not working, you will get your x mark over here. So, because it's not taking the path. So, let me just remove this, but in case if it isn't some other folder not in the same HTML because my files everything attention the same HTML folder."
"3261.5"," So, that's the reason I'm showing box. So, in case if you're just going to take apart from any of this folder to some other folder. If you're going to have image and in case if you want to access that image at that and you need to pass your path that is your folder path. Okay."
"3276.5"," And now you just need to pass and you just need to refresh will get your image. Okay. So, yesterday we saw about market of image right. So, that like this is how we will be adding image. So, once this image is added. So, let me reduce my size. Let it be of 700. Okay. I will just pass my market. I will just pass my market."
"3307.5"," Okay. So, if you're just passing my two over the image, if you're just going and if you're just going to refresh, you will get your scroll of an image. Okay. Yes, you know, what is your query?"
"3320.5"," I just case any other doubts. You know, is there any other query you want to ask?"
"3340.5"," So, guys, I'll wait for you. If there is any other query, you can just ping in the chat."
"3347.5"," Okay. So, can we resize the image as device screen size? Yeah, it is possible. But then like all the time it is not possible because background image, we can set like that. But this image, we need to specify a while, heightened with or else we will be having a divide tag."
"3366.5"," Like we need to use inside this like we will be setting some frame and inside that will be using our divide tag and inside that will be passing our image. If it is not going to be a background image, if it is going to be the external image, which you want to pass to your webpage means we will be having frames that is you will be setting the height and weather of your image. So, considered in Amazon, we saw right because here it is some advanced to concept. Okay. So, here what they will do they will set a frame. Okay."
"3394.5"," So, this would be one of the frame and this would be one of the frame and this is the text and here this would be the frame. So, inside that frame, they are just specifying what they are just placing there with. So, if I'm going to have my divide tag. So, this is like when they will be using some divide tags in order to divide the entire screen."
"3414.5"," So, it would be like they will be using 8 divide tags and they will just split the screen and they will just have the image over here. This is would be some advanced will be using frames and inside that frame will be passing our divide tag. First will divide the like size and width of our website. So, once that website size has been split."
"3433.5"," So, inside that first divide tag will pass the image. Okay. Like that we need to here you can see right it is split it equally into four parts which represents they are using some divide tags. Okay."
"3446.5"," Okay. Okay. How the same website seeing in laptop and mobile resizing. Yeah. So, that is like a for mobile interface. There will be some other because if when it comes to application that will be two types of application. One would be the web application and another one would be the mobile application."
"3466.5"," So, if I'm going to design for my website. I will just consider this green resolution of either my laptop or my PC right. So, in case I'm going to design for my mobile I will have some other interface in order to design that. So, we will be having our Android. So, in that Android I will just use my frames or in like I will just have my navigation over there and I will create their over because for mobile application will separate like design separately."
"3493.5"," And for web application will be designing separately and that's the reason whenever we are opening it is just fitting. So, this is all about website and the will be using our HTML JavaScript or just getting styles sheets."
"3506.5"," So, in case of what is going to be mobile will be using some other set of applications."
"3512.5"," Okay. Any other doubts please."
"3523.5"," Okay. Yes, mono is it here."
"3530.5"," Yeah. So, yes, finally, let's see what are the list. So, list is nothing but so, in case if I want to list my values like if I want to add any bulletings I can go ahead and use my list it."
"3551.5"," So, in list we will be having two types. So, one would be the ordered list and another one would be like an ordered list right. So, I will be having list will be having."
"3561.5"," So, if when it comes to listed tag. So, what are the value I need to pass. I will pass inside my E and I. So, I like the presence list. I will just close my list also right."
"3572.5"," So, basically we will be having two types of list one would be like ordered list."
"3577.5"," Okay. So, I will be having numberings over here like one to three like that I will be having numberings. So, this we call it as ordered list."
"3585.5"," So, how would be the syntax means I will be having ordered list attack. So, inside that I will pass how many list values I need to pass."
"3593.5"," So, if it is like apple or an I will have my list. Okay. I will pass my I will pass my first list. Okay. I will just end my first list."
"3602.5"," I'll just open my another list. So, it will have a it will show in a format of yeah no issues no issues. Okay. I will have like this."
"3611.5"," Apple or orange like that. Okay. So, it would be in a format of number one and number two. So, this we call it as ordered list."
"3620.5"," I will close my order list also right. So, this will be enough amount of numbering one and show this we call it as ordered list."
"3628.5"," And when it comes to unordered list. So, it is similar to our bulletings. Okay."
"3634.5"," So, if it is like unordered list, how I will be having this syntax is I will be having you will and make sure what are the value we are going to pass we need to use our list data. Okay."
"3644.5"," So, then only it will be considered as first and second. Okay. I will just have my apple here. So, what it will do it will create one bulletings over here. Okay."
"3653.5"," I will just close my list it and if I'm going to pass another one again. I will pass my list it and again. I will just give the second fruit name. Okay. This would be like again bulletings. Okay."
"3667.5"," So, if it is like if I'm going to use ordered list, it would be in a format of one to three four. And if I'm going to use unordered list, it would be in a format of bulletings."
"3676.5"," But what are the value you are going to pass inside the list, you must have LL data. So, that represents a list data. Okay. So, hope it's clear. I will show you how to add this and our HTML as well. Okay."
"3690.5"," So, now if I'm going back to my HTML means. So, let us add. Okay. I will just remove some of these."
"3702.5"," And I will just add my listings in the top of my page. Okay. So, I will just create one break tab over here after this. I will just create or just give it over here."
"3716.5"," I will just create. But let's first create with ordered list. Okay. We just specify ordered list. And inside this order list, I will create my list value. Okay. So, let's take a paragraph or let's take what are the values or what are we did. So, let's take paragraph."
"3735.5"," And what we did is we have added some links over there. So, we need to close it. So, after this, we have just added our link. So, let's take we have added our internal link."
"3749.5"," So, we have also added our external link. So, I will pass another one list. It must be of my external link."
"3765.5"," And I will pass my another one value. Okay. So, that is going to be my image. Right. So, I have added my image also. So, we did. So, let's close this. And finally, I will close my ordered list tag. So, these are the values, which I'm going to represent in a format of one, two, three, four, five. Now, when I'm just going to save and run in my browser."
"3791.5"," Here, you can see right because these are the format. These are in the format of list. So, I'm getting one, two, three, four, five because it represents ordered list. Right. So, it is just listing. So, here also you can specify your font style and you can give it in a center. So, certain means you will be using your center tag. So, every property you can add, but then you just need to add it over here. Like before you are starting. So, if it is going to be."
"3817.5"," So, you just need to give your font. Okay. If you want to give different font, you just need to go and give over here. Font face."
"3828.5"," So, let me have."
"3830.5"," Okay. We'll just take any one of my font. I will just pass my font."
"3843.5"," And I can also end my font style. So, this font will be finally available for my list tag. And also in this place, if I'm going to pass you will tag, it will be in a format of bulletings. I will not get my numbers over here."
"3859.5"," But then I will get my bulletings. Okay. Can you see the difference? So, I guess the font has not been added."
"3869.5"," So, let me check it once."
"3890.5"," Okay. And also if you want to make this as a heading, you can also again pass. But in case if you're going to pass your heading, we cannot give our font."
"3900.5"," So, either you need to pass your headings or you need to give your font and bold properties. So, as of now, let me give in a format of H3 tag that will close my H3 tag."
"3912.5"," Okay. So, as I said, tag this not case sensitive. So, you can either go ahead and give it like a capital or small letter. It will be reflecting in our link. Okay. Sorry. In our list. So, this is what we saw like two types of link one would be like ordered and another one would be of unordered list. So, if it is ordered, it will be in a format of 123 or if it is in unordered, but we'll be getting a bulletings over here."
"3940.5"," So, yes, this is any other doubts regarding this like what we saw link heading tag paragraph tag or image any other doubts."
"3951.5"," Yes. Yes. That's it from I side guys. If there is any doubt, you can just reach out to us. Okay. So, I'll in this meet. So, if there is any queries, if you can ping or not, you can just in this."
"3969.5"," Yes. I hope there is no queries. So, with me in this, thank you so much. Please have a good day."
