"start","content"
"0.0"," So, you can have definitely it's online, right?"
"3.64"," So, either you bring it to your local or if it is not then probably you have to sign in"
"7.5600000000000005"," and then get it from there."
"9.8"," Hmm."
"30.0"," So, what I will do is, by tonight maybe tomorrow morning you can just download the presentation."
"41.120000000000005"," In that I will just provide all the cheat scene because see now at least the concept you"
"44.36"," have got, right?"
"45.36"," That what is Docker?"
"46.36"," What is Docker means what is Docker composed, right?"
"49.44"," And then how to build this and why do we really need?"
"52.92"," Now next thing is we only need the commands that how to execute do."
"56.84"," And definitely if you are if you are really interested in DevOps kind of thing then probably"
"62.2"," then you need to do that with Docker that is suppose if you want to manage the resources"
"66.68"," then how can we do that if you want to scale down, scale up at the run and then how can"
"70.80000000000001"," we manage inside the Docker."
"72.4"," So, those things probably for that you need to give more into the Docker."
"76.52000000000001"," But from a developer, development point of view I'm from a developer point of view, understanding"
"81.68"," understanding of having what is the Docker image, how to create a Docker image then what"
"86.28"," are the Docker compose and what are the multiple commands to commands to commands available"
"92.32000000000001"," in Docker for like to create the image, build the image, run the Docker, create a container,"
"98.76"," set down the container and run the Docker compose and set down the Docker composing on"
"103.36"," that."
"104.36"," So, suppose sometime, right?"
"108.84"," If you don't want to install any of the software locally, right?"
"113.6"," So even for iceberg or anything you want to practice, right?"
"116.16"," You can simply go with Docker that will really help."
"118.91999999999999"," So in that is what will happen is whatever you need, you can just use it later point in"
"122.88"," that you can you know, uh, uh, set down that take an example."
"126.67999999999999"," I have these three run."
"128.95999999999998"," So suppose I don't need last six hours now, I'll just set it down because the more services"
"133.04"," that is running in your laptop or in your machine, right?"
"135.48"," It will slow down."
"137.16"," So that's it is in what will happen is maybe I may I may I may be having multiple containers"
"141.72"," for iceberg for it's no, hopefully, I mean, for post-space for last research for any other"
"146.0"," services."
"147.0"," I'll just start only those services which is really required for me and I'll set down"
"151.8"," the other services."
"155.24"," So in that case, you don't really need to because see what happens is whenever we try"
"159.44"," to install anything in my machine, right?"
"162.0"," We used to set the home path, Java path, something like that."
"165.2"," A lot of things that we do right."
"167.2"," When environment path, then system path and all that, but in case of containerization,"
"171.83999999999997"," right, we don't have to do all this doctor will handle it by itself and it will not create"
"177.16"," any conflict as well."
"183.67999999999998"," So now as part of the assignment, right, I'll provide you with this doctor file and all"
"188.72"," that so that you I'll provide this doctor file."
"191.16"," I'll provide you."
"193.16"," I'll provide you the sequel and all this all this basic setup things, right?"
"196.68"," I'll provide you."
"197.68"," You just need to run this command so that at least your setup is complete."
"201.0"," On top of that, you have to build the build the code and then create whatever EPL and"
"206.68"," this assignment that would be provided to you."
"213.68"," So in your case, the last research will not be there, but this is just example."
"222.16"," And probably Friday is the last station, right?"
"224.72"," So Friday, please bring up any any questions that you have and whatever caption project"
"230.08"," that I'll be providing you right I'll provide the GitHub link."
"233.6"," What you can do is you can create a branch out of that and just publish your changes into"
"237.64"," that even so that later point in time, right?"
"240.6"," I can just validate and I can review your code and I can comment into that so that you know"
"245.56"," via the GitHub, we can communicate whether your assignment has been complete or not or"
"249.04"," if you have any doubt in that assignment."
"253.44"," I would be checking all your so in suppose I'm having a main branch right inside that"
"257.96"," main branch with your name, suppose they've been concrete is his own feature branch like"
"262.52"," you know, kind of from that you when you can create a home branch, right?"
"266.76"," So maybe for each and every person, right, they would be branches."
"269.72"," So what I can do is for every checking that you do, I can go to branches, I can see if"
"274.36"," the code is working fine or not, if the design is up to date or not."
"278.2"," And if I have any comment, I'll add the comments there and if you have any questions and if"
"281.88"," you have any resolution, you can add the comment there and using that, right, we can just"
"286.44"," complete our assignment and we can communicate as well."
"290.48"," So before the project, I think we wanted to cover a few more things, I believe the security"
"298.84"," question that is that we have and that."
"302.0"," Yeah, that means that you've got it."
"307.0"," So the high level embedding is anything covered, right, that what is embedding, but we wanted"
"313.4"," to do that practically, right, database into embeddings."
"317.0"," So these three tasks would be origin, actually, I thought that this part, right, this part"
"339.04"," was today's agenda, but anyway with interest of time, you cannot complete this, but we'll"
"343.12"," do that."
"344.12"," No problem."
"345.12"," But before we get into this embedding site, for embedding site, at least whatever we"
"360.16"," have discussed, right, please go through that so that whenever we do a hands on that,"
"364.64"," it would be very quick for us."
"368.08"," Yeah."
"370.32"," So other than this, they won't any other topics to be covered."
"378.12"," So how to train our model, I think that is covered under this ML office, right, training."
"382.92"," Actually, okay, so there are two part of the training, right, the first part is that,"
"388.71999999999997"," you know, you are building your model first, right?"
"390.92"," So how are you going to build your model that we have, we have done the hands on, right,"
"395.08"," that using this algorithm, if you remember, right, predictive algorithm and all that, using"
"399.32"," the Python library of SQL learn is there, then tensor flow is there, there are so many"
"404.0"," libraries are there."
"405.0"," So first is building the library, the model, then training the model, then third is deploying"
"415.52"," the model."
"419.03999999999996"," So this is done."
"422.64"," This is part of ML office."
"426.0"," This is actually this is little time time."
"427.72"," I will try to cover a bit because this to train the model, right, we need some, we need"
"433.12"," some concepts of mathematical formula because suppose taking example, if any algorithm,"
"437.72"," right, then before we train the model, how are you going to calculate that if the, you"
"442.56"," know, calculate the accuracy?"
"445.36"," So what I'll do is I'll try to cover as much as possible and then I'll provide some"
"449.32"," documentation on top of this because this training the model is little creepy."
"454.28"," Why it is pretty because it is not common for all suppose if you take an example, if"
"459.44"," you are using one algorithm, suppose linear regression."
"465.4"," So linear regression will have its own purpose, right, that okay, using linear regression"
"470.28"," algorithm, I would be creating this model, which has this purpose."
"474.15999999999997"," So definitely if I'm going to train that model, which is built on linear regression."
"478.72"," So the train, the logic to train that model will be different than training a model, which"
"484.32000000000005"," is built on another algorithm that is random for a suppose, right."
"488.20000000000005"," So that's the reason this training the model is a kind of a big topic, but I'll try to"
"492.40000000000003"," at least provide a high level overview."
"494.72"," So and some documentation so that later point in time, you can just go through this."
"499.96000000000004"," Yeah."
"502.96000000000004"," So any other topic that you think that we should be covering."
"506.4"," So anyway, this would be part of ML of security we can cover quickly because we know how the"
"510.91999999999996"," security works in data engineering."
"513.36"," So if you know the how the security works in data engineering, then definitely we can"
"517.48"," understand how it will work in any life flow."
"519.92"," It won't take much time."
"522.8"," Any other topic that you want me to cover."
"530.04"," But before that, right, before the Friday station, please go through this."
"536.4"," So, you read part and please do one hands on on this."
"546.6"," At least write one single simple code, maybe you can go and so that other part would be"
"551.52"," easy."
"565.64"," Can you the topic that you want to cover?"
"569.28"," Is there anything you think which is very important in data engineering, but that is not covered"
"574.12"," as part of our topic?"
"576.12"," No, no, that is everything."
"577.84"," Yeah, I mean some in details some in high level because see as part of the data is in the"
"584.3199999999999"," ecosystem, right."
"585.6"," The major important part is ETL and then multiple aspect of ETL like ETL ELG."
"593.4"," Then if you go into each and every like then extraction, then you have to go to in details"
"597.36"," that how to extract how to extract in the sense we have discussed multiple times that"
"603.12"," how are you going to connect to your source?"
"605.76"," It could be via the tough kind of face or multiple use cases and multiple scenarios and"
"609.88"," multiple design options that either you can directly connect to your source database or"
"614.1999999999999"," you can have common interface where they would be producing the data you would be consuming"
"618.0"," it, right."
"619.0"," This is then transformation, multiple various to transform, third load, how to load the"
"633.04"," data and when you are talking about loading the data, then data model comes into the picture"
"639.84"," like dimensional model, then data world recovered all this, right."
"651.48"," Now whenever we are building ETL, our job is starting from the source to get the data"
"658.24"," from one place and then posting into another place."
"661.4"," Now within this journey there are many components that comes into the picture that data, data"
"668.08"," linear is not a component, it is a component but as part of the data linear we need data"
"672.64"," quality, data observability, right data reconstruction, correct."
"686.24"," And as part of the load as well this is also important, what is data warehouse, data like"
"695.28"," smart data."
"698.64"," So whatever, so this is one and then as part of the data linear data quality is there,"
"703.6"," data observability is there, data reconciliation is there, right."
"706.88"," And then as part of your data product, then we had the concept of data product, data marketplace"
"713.52"," and data virtualization, then we have data catalog, right."
"729.68"," Like suppose if you are going to build any data product, then how are you going to build"
"732.96"," that data product, like now how are you going to maintain your and then as part of the"
"736.92"," PLT in ETL, right, where both batch and streaming right."
"753.16"," So then this data card, like now you know then multiple data warehouses, like then we have"
"759.7199999999999"," open table format."
"765.36"," That was iceberg."
"769.48"," So these are the major major thing, other than this also we have covered a lot of other"
"773.28"," things but these are the major ones as part of the data engineering end to end."
"779.6800000000001"," Yeah, now, okay, right, but still like, you know if you come across any questions please"
"785.0"," bring it up, right."
"786.6800000000001"," And one question I am asking you please bring, come up with the answers on Friday that"
"791.28"," suppose extract data from��AL but please come up with this answer for us."
"816.28"," is come up with this answer for this. So, you got this right this is not a easy question"
"827.72"," that we see we know how to get the data from the source. We can just execute the query"
"832.8399999999999"," we can get some data, but you do not have to query the data. This is not exactly about"
"837.36"," the ETL, but this is about some aspect of the source. So, I am just given I have just"
"842.56"," taken or equalized considered or equalized source database. So, without querying the database"
"847.3599999999999"," how can you extract the data from our record? So, okay, but it is still like you know just"
"859.28"," we have one more session. So, please come up with any questions that we have. We can if"
"863.0"," needed we can have some extra time on Friday just to cover as much as possible plus, but"
"868.04"," please come up with any questions that you have or any extra topic that you want to"
"872.16"," cover. Yes. Okay. So, if there is no further questions"
"882.62"," I will just solve it after the session or if you want to if you have any questions you"
"885.62"," can continue. I think we are good. Okay. Thank you everyone. Thanks for your time."
"903.82"," Please connect one Monday is for Friday. Thank you."
